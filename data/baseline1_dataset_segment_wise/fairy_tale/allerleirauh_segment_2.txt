	Now the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had the same golden hair. When she was grown up the King looked at her one day, and saw that in every respect she was like his late wife, and suddenly felt a violent love for her. Then he spake to his councillors, 'I will marry my daughter, for she is the counterpart of my late wife, otherwise I can find no bride who resembles her.' When the councillors heard that, they were shocked, and said, 'God has forbidden a father to marry his daughter, no good can come from such a crime, and the kingdom will be involved in the ruin.'
