	The sun rose, and she slept on, and she was still sleeping when it was full day. Then it so happened that the King to whom this forest belonged, was hunting in it. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran barking round about it. The King said to the huntsmen, 'Just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in there.' The huntsmen obeyed his order, and when they came back they said, 'A wondrous beast is lying in the hollow tree; we have never before seen one like it. Its skin is fur of a thousand different kinds, but it is lying asleep.' Said the King, 'See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the carriage, and we will take it with us.' When the huntsmen laid hold of the maiden, she awoke full of terror, and cried to them, 'I am a poor child, deserted by father and mother; have pity on me, and take me with you.' Then said they, 'Allerleirauh, thou wilt be useful in the kitchen, come with us, and thou canst sweep up the ashes.' So they put her in the carriage, and took her home to the royal palace. There they pointed out to her a closet under the stairs, where no daylight entered, and said, 'Hairy animal, there canst thou live and sleep.' Then she was sent into the kitchen, and there she carried wood and water, swept the hearth, plucked the fowls, picked the vegetables, raked the ashes, and did all the dirty work.
