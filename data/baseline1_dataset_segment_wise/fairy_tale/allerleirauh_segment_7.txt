	She had, however, run into her little den, had quickly taken off her dress, made her face and hands black again, put on the fur-mantle, and again was Allerleirauh. And now when she went into the kitchen, and was about to get to her work and sweep up the ashes, the cook said, 'Leave that alone till morning, and make me the soup for the King; I, too, will go upstairs awhile, and take a look; but let no hairs fall in, or in future thou shalt have nothing to eat.' So the cook went away, and Allerleirauh made the soup for the king, and made bread soup and the best she could, and when it was ready she fetched her golden ring from her little den, and put it in the bowl in which the soup was served. When the dancing was over, the King had his soup brought and ate it, and he liked it so much that it seemed to him he had never tasted better. But when he came to the bottom of the bowl, he saw a golden ring lying, and could not conceive how it could have got there. Then he ordered the cook to appear before him. The cook was terrified when he heard the order, and said to Allerleirauh, 'Thou hast certainly let a hair fall into the soup, and if thou hast, thou shalt be beaten for it.' When he came before the King the latter asked who had made the soup? The cook replied, 'I made it.' But the King said, 'That is not true, for it was much better than usual, and cooked differently.' He answered, 'I must acknowledge that I did not make it, it was made by the rough animal.' The King said, 'Go and bid it come up here.'
