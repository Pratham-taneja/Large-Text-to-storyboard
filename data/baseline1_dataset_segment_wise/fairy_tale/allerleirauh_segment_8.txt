	When Allerleirauh came, the King said, 'Who art thou?' 'I am a poor girl who no longer has any father or mother.' He asked further, 'Of what use art thou in my palace?' She answered, 'I am good for nothing but to have boots thrown at my head.' He continued, 'Where didst thou get the ring which was in the soup?' She answered, 'I know nothing about the ring.' So the King could learn nothing, and had to send her away again.
