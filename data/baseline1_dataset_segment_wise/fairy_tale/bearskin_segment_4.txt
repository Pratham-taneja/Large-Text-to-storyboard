	The poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when she thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes. Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters. 'Take care,' said the eldest, 'if thou givest him thy hand, he will strike his claws into it.' 'Beware!' said the second. 'Bears like sweet things, and if he takes a fancy to thee, he will eat thee up.' 'Thou must always do as he likes,' began the elder again, 'or else he will growl.' And the second continued, 'But the wedding will be a merry one, for bears dance well.' The bride was silent, and did not let them vex her. Bearskin, however, travelled about the world from one place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously to the poor that they might pray for him.
