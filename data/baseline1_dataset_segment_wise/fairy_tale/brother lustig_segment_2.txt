'No,' answered Brother Lustig, 'thou must go first,' and he thought, 'if the water is too deep I will stay behind.' Then St. Peter strode through it, and the water just reached to his knee. So Brother Lustig began to go through also, but the water grew deeper and reached to his throat. Then he cried, 'Brother, help me!' St. Peter said, 'Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb's heart?' 'No,' said he, 'I have not eaten it.' Then the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth. 'Help me, brother,' cried the soldier. St. Peter said, 'Then wilt thou confess that thou hast eaten the lamb's heart?' 'No,' he replied, 'I have not eaten it.' St. Peter, however, would not let him be drowned, but made the water sink and helped him through it.
