And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an hour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again. Then the maiden carried the dishes to the step-mother and was delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the festival. But the step-mother said, 'All this will not help thee; thou goest not with us, for thou hast no clothes and canst not dance; we should be ashamed of thee!' On this she turned her back on Cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters.
