	It came to pass that the master one day said to her, 'Grethel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.' 'I will see to it, master,' answered Grethel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Grethel called out to her master, 'If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten directly, when they are juiciest.' The master said, 'I will run myself, and fetch the guest.' When the master had turned his back, Grethel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought, 'Standing so long by the fire there, makes one hot and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.' She ran down, set a jug, said, 'God bless it to thy use, Grethel,' and took a good drink, and took yet another hearty draught.
