The mother of Hans said, 'Whither away, Hans?' Hans answered, 'To Grethel.' 'Behave well, Hans.' 'Oh, I'll behave well. Good-bye, mother.' 'Good-bye, Hans.' Hans comes to Grethel, 'Good day, Grethel.' 'Good day, Hans. What dost thou bring that is good?' 'I bring nothing, I want to have something given me.' Grethel presents Hans with a needle. Hans says, 'Good-bye, Grethel.' 'Good-bye, Hans.'
