	Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart home. 'Good evening, mother.' 'Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?' 'With Grethel.' 'What didst thou take her?' 'Took nothing; had something given me.' 'What did Grethel give thee?' 'Gave me a needle.' 'Where is the needle, Hans?' 'Stuck it in the hay-cart.' 'That was ill done, Hans. Thou shouldst have stuck the needle in thy sleeve.' 'Never mind, I'll do better next time.'
