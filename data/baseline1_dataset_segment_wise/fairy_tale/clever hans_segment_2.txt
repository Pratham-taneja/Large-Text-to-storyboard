	'Whither away, Hans?' 'To Grethel, mother.' 'Behave well, Hans.' 'Oh, I'll behave well. Good-bye, mother.' 'Good-bye, Hans.'

	Hans comes to Grethel. 'Good day, Grethel.' 'Good day, Hans. What dost thou bring that is good?' 'I bring nothing; I want to have something given to me.' Grethel presents Hans with a knife. 'Good-bye, Grethel.' 'Good-bye Hans.' Hans takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. 'Good evening, mother.' 'Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?' 'With Grethel.' 'What didst thou take her?' 'Took her nothing, she gave me something.' 'What did Grethel give thee?' 'Gave me a knife.' 'Where is the knife, Hans?' 'Stuck in my sleeve.' 'That's ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have put the knife in thy pocket.' 'Never mind, will do better next time.' 'Whither away, Hans?' 'To Grethel, mother.' 'Behave well, Hans.' 'Oh, I'll behave well. Good-bye, mother.' 'Good-bye, Hans.'
