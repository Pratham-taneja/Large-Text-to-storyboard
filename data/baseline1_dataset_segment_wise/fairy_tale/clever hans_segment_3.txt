	Hans comes to Grethel. 'Good day, Grethel.' 'Good day, Hans. What good thing dost thou bring?' 'I bring nothing, I want something given me.' Grethel presents Hans with a young goat. 'Good-bye, Grethel.' 'Good-bye, Hans.' Hans takes the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it is suffocated. 'Good evening, mother.' 'Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?' 'With Grethel.' 'What didst thou take her?' 'Took nothing, she gave me something.' 'What did Grethel give thee?' 'She gave me a goat.' 'Where is the goat, Hans?' 'Put it in my pocket.' 'That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have put a rope round the goat's neck.' 'Never mind, will do better next time.'
