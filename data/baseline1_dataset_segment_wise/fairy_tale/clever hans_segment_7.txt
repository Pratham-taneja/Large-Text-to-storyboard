	Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face. 'Good evening, mother.' 'Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?' 'With Grethel.' 'What didst thou take her?' 'I took nothing, but had something given me.' 'What did Grethel give thee?' 'A calf.' 'Where hast thou the calf, Hans?' 'I set it on my head and it kicked my face.' 'That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have led the calf, and put it in the stall.' 'Never mind, will do better next time.'

	'Whither away, Hans?' 'To Grethel, mother.' 'Behave well, Hans.' 'I'll behave well. Good-bye, mother.' 'Good-bye, Hans.'
