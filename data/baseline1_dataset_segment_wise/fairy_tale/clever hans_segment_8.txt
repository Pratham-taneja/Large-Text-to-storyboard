	Hans comes to Grethel. 'Good day, Grethel.' 'Good day, Hans. What good thing dost thou bring?' 'I bring nothing, but would have something given.' Grethel says to Hans, 'I will go with thee.'

	Hans takes Grethel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack and binds her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. 'Good evening, mother.' 'Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?' 'With Grethel.' 'What didst thou take her?' 'I took her nothing.' 'What did Grethel give thee?' 'She gave me nothing, she came with me.' 'Where hast thou left Grethel?' 'I led her by the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.' 'That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have cast friendly eyes on her.' 'Never mind, will do better.'
