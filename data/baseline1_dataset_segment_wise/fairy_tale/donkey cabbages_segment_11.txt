	After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him that the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal daily was dead; 'the two others,' he continued, 'are certainly not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they cannot last much longer.' The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him. And when they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they became human again. The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him, and said, 'Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you; my mother drove me to it; it was done against my will, for I love you dearly. Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the bird's-heart I will take a vomiting potion.' But he thought otherwise, and said, 'Keep it; it is all the same, for I will take thee for my true wife.' So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily together until their death.
