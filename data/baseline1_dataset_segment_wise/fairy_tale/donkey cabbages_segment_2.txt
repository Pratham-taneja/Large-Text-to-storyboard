It came to pass, that one day he travelled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle. An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of the windows. The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the maiden, 'There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his body, we must filch it from him, my dear daughter, it is more suitable for us than for him. He has a bird's heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow.' She told her what she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with angry eyes, 'And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the worse for you.' Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to himself, 'I have travelled about for such a long time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle. I have certainly money enough.' Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl.
