	Then the old witch said, 'We have the bird's heart, but we must also take the wishing-cloak away from him.' The girl answered, 'We will leave him that, he has lost his wealth.' The old woman was angry and said, 'Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found in this world. I must and will have it!' She gave the girl several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with her. So she did the old woman's bidding, placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful. The huntsman asked, 'Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully?' 'Ah, my beloved,' was her answer, 'over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain, where the precious stones grow. I long for them so much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them? Only the birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.' 'Hast thou nothing else to complain of?' said the huntsman. 'I will soon remove that burden from thy heart.' With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet Mountain, and in the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together. Precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see them, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them. Now, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes of the huntsman should become heavy. He said to the maiden, 'We will sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer stand on my feet.' Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished herself back at home with them.
