	When the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and said, 'Dear countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.' 'Why not?' answered he, 'I have brought two heads with me, and will give you one of them,' and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage. The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it. When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an ass. Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up; but on the way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate a couple of leaves. Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman, and the dish of salad fell to the ground. Meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, 'I don't know what has become of the salad.' The huntsman thought, 'The salad must have already taken effect,' and said, 'I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.' As he went down he saw the two asses running about in the courtyard; the salad, however, was lying on the ground. 'All right,' said he, 'the two have taken their portion,' and he picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden. 'I bring you the delicate food myself,' said he, 'in order that you may not have to wait longer.' Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.
