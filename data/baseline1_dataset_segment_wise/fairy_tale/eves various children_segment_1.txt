After all they are all of them my children, whom I have brought into the world, thy favours should be given to all alike.' But God answered, 'Eve, thou dost not understand. It is right and necessary that the entire world should be supplied from thy children; if they were all princes and lords, who would grow corn, thresh it, grind and bake it? Who would be blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters, masons, labourers, tailors and seamstresses? Each shall have his own place, so that one shall support the other, and all shall be fed like the limbs of one body.' Then Eve answered, 'Ah, Lord, forgive me, I was too quick in speaking to thee. Have thy divine will with my children.'
