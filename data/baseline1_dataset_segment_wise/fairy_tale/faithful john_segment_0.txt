There was once on a time an old king who was ill, and thought to himself, 'I am lying on what must be my death-bed.' Then said he, 'Tell Faithful John to come to me.' Faithful John was his favourite servant, and was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so true to him. When therefore he came beside the bed, the King said to him, 'Most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no anxiety except about my son. He is still of tender age, and cannot always know how to guide himself. If thou dost not promise me to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I cannot close my eyes in peace.' Then answered Faithful John, 'I will not forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should cost me my life.' On this, the old King said, 'Now I die in comfort and peace.' Then he added, 'After my death, thou shalt show him the whole castle: all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the Golden Dwelling, shalt thou not show. If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go through great danger for her sake, therefore thou must preserve him from that.' And when Faithful John had once more given his promise to the old King about this, the King said no more, but laid his head on his pillow, and died.
