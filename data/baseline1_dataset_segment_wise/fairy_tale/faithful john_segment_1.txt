	When the old King had been carried to his grave, Faithful John told the young King all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, 'This will I assuredly perform, and will be faithful to thee as I have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.' When the mourning was over, Faithful John said to him, 'It is now time that thou shouldst see thine inheritance. I will show thee thy father's palace.' Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was one room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous picture. The picture was, however, so placed that when the door was opened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful in the whole world. The young King, however, plainly remarked that Faithful John always walked past this one door, and said, 'Why dost thou never open this one for me?' 'There is something within it,' he replied, 'which would terrify thee.' But the King answered, 'I have seen all the palace, and I will know what is in this room also,' and he went and tried to break open the door by force. Then Faithful John held him back and said, 'I promised thy father before his death that thou shouldst not see that which is in this chamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on thee and on me.' 'Ah, no,' replied the young King, 'if I do not go in, it will be my certain destruction. I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes. I shall not leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door.'
