'Good,' said the King, 'he shall carry me to my palace,' and was about to mount it when Faithful John got before him, jumped quickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the horse. Then the other attendants of the King, who after all were not very fond of Faithful John, cried, 'How shameful to kill the beautiful animal, that was to have carried the King to his palace.' But the King said, 'Hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John, who knows what may be the good of that!' They went into the palace, and in the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment looking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver. The young King went towards it and was about to take hold of it, but Faithful John pushed him away, seized it with gloves on, carried it quickly to the fire and burnt it. The other attendants again began to murmur, and said, 'Behold, now he is even burning the King's bridal garment!' But the young King said, 'Who knows what good he may have done, leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.'
