And as often as he looked on it he wept and said, 'Ah, if I could bring thee to life again, my most faithful John.' Some time passed and the Queen bore twins, two sons who grew fast and were her delight. Once when the Queen was at church and the two children were sitting playing beside their father, the latter full of grief again looked at the stone figure, sighed and said, 'Ah, if I could but bring thee to life again, my most faithful John.' Then the stone began to speak and said, 'Thou canst bring me to life again if thou wilt use for that purpose what is dearest to thee.' Then cried the King, 'I will give everything I have in the world for thee.' The stone continued, 'If thou wilt will cut off the heads of thy two children with thine own hand, and sprinkle me with their blood, I shall be restored to life.'
