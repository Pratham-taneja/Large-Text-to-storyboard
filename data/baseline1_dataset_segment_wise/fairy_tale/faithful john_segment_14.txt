	The King was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his dearest children, but he thought of faithful John's great fidelity, and how he had died for him, drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life returned to it, and Faithful John stood once more safe and healthy before him. He said to the King, 'Thy truth shall not go unrewarded,' and took the heads of the children, put them on again, and rubbed the wounds with their blood, on which they became whole again immediately, and jumped about, and went on playing as if nothing had happened. Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming he hid Faithful John and the two children in a great cupboard. When she entered, he said to her, 'Hast thou been praying in the church?' 'Yes,' answered she, 'but I have constantly been thinking of Faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us.' Then said he, 'Dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will cost us our two little sons, whom we must sacrifice.' The Queen turned pale, and her heart was full of terror, but she said, 'We owe it to him, for his great fidelity.' Then the King was rejoiced that she thought as he had thought, and went and opened the cupboard, and brought forth Faithful John and the children, and said, 'God be praised, he is delivered, and we have our little sons again also,' and told her how everything had occurred. Then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death.
