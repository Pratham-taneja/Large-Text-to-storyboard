When he had opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing before him he could hide the portrait so that the King should not see it in front of him, but what availed that? The King stood on tip-toe and saw it over his shoulder. And when he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and precious stones, he fell fainting to the ground. Faithful John took him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought, 'The misfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it?' Then he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again. The first words the King said were, 'Ah, the beautiful portrait! whose it it?' 'That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling,' answered Faithful John. Then the King continued, 'My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they could not declare it. I will give my life to win her. Thou art my most Faithful John, thou must help me.'
