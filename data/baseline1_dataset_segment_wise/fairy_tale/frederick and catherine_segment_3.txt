'Ah, but, Frederick, I must, it weighs me down far too much.' 'Then do it and be hanged!' So she emptied out the vinegar, and it besprinkled the robbers. They said amongst themselves, 'The dew is already falling.' At length Catherine thought, 'Can it really be the door which weighs me down so?' and said, 'Frederick, I must throw the door down.' 'No, not now, Catherine, it might discover us.' 'Oh, but, Frederick, I must. It weighs me down far too much.' 'Oh, no, Catherine, do hold it fast.' 'Ah, Frederick, I am letting it fall!' 'Let it go, then, in the devil's name.' Then it fell down with a violent clatter, and the rascals below cried, 'The devil is coming down the tree!' and they ran away and left everything behind them. Early next morning, when the two came down they found all their gold again, and carried it home.
