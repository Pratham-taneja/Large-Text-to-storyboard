	It was not long before the youth was the most famous physician in the whole world. 'He had only to look at the patient and he knew his condition at once, and if he would recover, or must needs die.' So they said of him, and from far and wide people came to him, sent for him when they had any one ill, and gave him so much money that he soon became a rich man. Now it so befell that the King became ill, and the physician was summoned, and was to say if recovery were possible. But when he came to the bed, Death was standing by the feet of the sick man, and the herb did not grow which could save him. 'If I could but cheat Death for once,' thought the physician, 'he is sure to take it ill if I do, but, as I am his godson, he will shut one eye; I will risk it.' He therefore took up the sick man, and laid him the other way, so that now Death was standing by his head. Then he gave the King some of the herb, and he recovered and grew healthy again. But Death came to the physician, looking very black and angry, threatened him with his finger, and said, 'Thou hast overreached me; this time I will pardon it, as thou art my godson; but if thou venturest it again, it will cost thee thy neck, for I will take thee thyself away with me.'
