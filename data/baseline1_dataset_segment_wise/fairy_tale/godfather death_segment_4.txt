	When Death saw that for a second time he was defrauded of his own property, he walked up to the physician with long strides, and said, 'All is over with thee, and now the lot falls on thee,' and seized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand, that he could not resist, and led him into a cave below the earth. There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows, some large, others half-sized, others small. Every instant some were extinguished, and others again burnt up, so that the flames seemed to leap hither and thither in perpetual change. 'See,' said Death, 'these are the lights of men's lives. The large ones belong to children, the half-sized ones to married people in their prime, the little ones belong to old people; but children and young folks likewise have often only a tiny candle.' 'Show me the light of my life,' said the physician, and he thought that it would be still very tall. Death pointed to a little end which was just threatening to go out, and said, 'Behold, it is there.' 'Ah, dear godfather,' said the horrified physician, 'light a new one for me, do it for love of me, that I may enjoy my life, be King, and the husband of the King's beautiful daughter.' 'I cannot,' answered Death, 'one must go out before a new one is lighted.' 'Then place the old one on a new one, that will go on burning at once when the old one has come to an end,' pleaded the physician. Death behaved as if he were going to fulfill his wish, and took hold of a tall new candle; but as he desired to revenge himself, he purposely made a mistake in fixing it, and the little piece fell down and was extinguished. Immediately the physician fell on the ground, and now he himself was in the hands of Death.
