Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, 'Master, my time is up; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother; give me my wages.' The master answered, 'You have served me faithfully and honestly; as the service was so shall the reward be;' and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home.
