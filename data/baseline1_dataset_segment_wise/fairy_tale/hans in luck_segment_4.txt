After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, 'Jup! Jup!' The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him.
