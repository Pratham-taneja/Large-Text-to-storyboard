Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one's milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow.' 'Well,' said the countryman, 'if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.' Hans agreed with the greatest delight; the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away.
