He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst. 'I can find a cure for this,' thought Hans; 'I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk.' He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath; but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was.
