THERE was once a countryman who had money and land in plenty, but how rich soever he was, one thing was still wanting in his happiness he had no children. Often when he went into the town with the other peasants they mocked him and asked why he had no children. At last he became angry, and when he got home he said, 'I will have a child, even if it be a hedgehog.' Then his wife had a child, that was a hedgehog in the upper part of his body, and a boy in the lower, and when she saw the child, she was terrified, and said, 'See, there thou hast brought ill-luck on us.' Then said the man, 'What can be done now? The boy must be christened, but we shall not be able to get a godfather for him.' The woman said, 'And we cannot call him anything else but Hans the Hedgehog.'
