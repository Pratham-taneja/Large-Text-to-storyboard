But the King's daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. 'Art thou the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?' asked the King. 'Yes,' answered he, 'and here the apples are,' and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the King. 'If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.' 'If thou canst perform such deeds as that, thou art no gardener's boy; tell me, who is thy father?' 'My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.' 'I well see,' said the King, 'that I owe thanks to thee; can I do anything to please thee?' 'Yes,' answered he, 'that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.' The maiden laughed, and said, 'He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener's boy,' and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, 'I am Iron John, and was by enchantment a wild man, but thou hast set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be thy property.'
