	The King had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the court-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said, 'Give me my ball out.' 'Not till thou hast opened the door for me,' answered the man. 'No,' said the boy, 'I will not do that; the King has forbidden it,' and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said, 'Open my door,' but the boy would not. On the third day the King had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, 'I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.' Then the wild man said, 'It lies under thy mother's pillow, thou canst get it there.' The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him, 'Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!' The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the King came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the Queen how that had happened? She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The King sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.
