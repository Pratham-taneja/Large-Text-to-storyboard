	The King said to his daughter, 'I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and thou shalt throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown will come to it.' When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron John. 'What dost thou desire?' asked he. 'That I may catch the King's daughter's golden apple.' 'It is as safe as if thou hadst it already,' said Iron John. 'Thou shalt likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.' When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The King's daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.
