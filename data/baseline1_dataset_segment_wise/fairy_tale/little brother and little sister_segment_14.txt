	The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt. She washed the blood off him, laid herbs on the wound, and said, 'Go to your bed, dear roe, that you may get well again.' But the wound was so slight that the roebuck, next morning, did not feel it any more. And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, 'I cannot bear it, I must be there; they shall not find it so easy to catch me.' The sister cried, and said, 'This time they will kill you, and here am I alone in the forest and forsaken by all the world. I will not let you out.' 'Then you will have me die of grief,' answered the roe; 'when I hear the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.' Then the sister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for him with a heavy heart, and the roebuck, full of health and joy, bounded into the forest.
