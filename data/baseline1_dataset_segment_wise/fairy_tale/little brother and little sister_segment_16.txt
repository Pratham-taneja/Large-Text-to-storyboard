	As soon as the sun had set, the King said to the huntsman, 'Now come and show me the cottage in the wood;' and when he was at the door, he knocked and called out, 'Dear little sister, let me in.' Then the door opened, and the King walked in, and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen. The maiden was frightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who wore a golden crown upon his head. But the King looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and said, 'Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?' 'Yes, indeed,' answered the maiden, 'but the little roe must go with me, I cannot leave him.' The King said, 'It shall stay with you as long as you live, and shall want nothing.' Just then he came running in, and the sister again tied him with the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and went away with the King from the cottage.
