At first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found at length that it was home-sickness: although she was many thousand times better off here than at home, still she had a longing to be there. At last she said to the old woman, 'I have a longing for home; and however well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go up again to my own people.' Mother Holle said, 'I am pleased that you long for your home again, and as you have served me so truly, I myself will take you up again.' Thereupon she took her by the hand, and led her to a large door. The door was opened, and just as the maiden was standing beneath the doorway, a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the gold remained sticking to her, so that she was completely covered over with it.
