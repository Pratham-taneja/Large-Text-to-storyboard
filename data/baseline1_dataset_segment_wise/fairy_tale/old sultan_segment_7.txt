	The dog and the cat, when they came up, wondered that there was no one to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to hide himself altogether; and one of his ears was still to be seen. Whilst the cat was looking carefully about, the boar moved his ear; the cat, who thought it was a mouse moving there, jumped upon it and bit it hard. The boar made a fearful noise and ran away, crying out, 'The guilty one is up in the tree.' The dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf, who was ashamed of having shown himself so timid, and made friends with the dog.
