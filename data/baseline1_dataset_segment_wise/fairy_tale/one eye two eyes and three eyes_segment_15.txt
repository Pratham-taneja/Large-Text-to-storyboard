	When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears. Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, 'Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?' 'Have I not reason to weep?' she answered. 'The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.' The wise woman said, 'Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.' Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, 'Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don't wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.' Then they laughed and said, 'If that's all you want, you can have it.' So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do.
