	'Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,'

	and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen. Then Two-eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, 'Lord God, be with us always, Amen,' and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it. And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman had taught her,

	'Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,'

	and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again. 'That is a delightful way of keeping house!' thought Two-eyes, and was quite glad and happy.
