	and in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, 'One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.' So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, 'I fell asleep when I was out.'
