	It was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey. She called the girl before her, and asked to have the keys of heaven back. When the maiden gave her the bunch, the Virgin looked into her eyes and said, 'Hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also?' 'No,' she replied. Then she laid her hand on the girl's heart, and felt how it beat and beat, and saw right well that she had disobeyed her order and had opened the door. Then she said once again, 'Art thou certain that thou hast not done it?' 'Yes,' said the girl, for the second time. Then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time 'Hast thou not done it?' 'No,' said the girl for the third time. Then said the Virgin Mary, 'Thou hast not obeyed me, and besides that thou hast lied, thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven.'
