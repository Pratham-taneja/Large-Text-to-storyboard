	The following year the Queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter, and for the third time the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night and said, 'Follow me.' She took the Queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her there her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing with the ball of the world. When the Queen rejoiced thereat, the Virgin Mary said, 'Is thy heart not yet softened? If thou wilt own that thou openedst the forbidden door, I will give thee back thy two little sons.' But for the third time the Queen answered, 'No, I did not open the forbidden door.' Then the Virgin let her sink down to earth once more, and took from her likewise her third child.
