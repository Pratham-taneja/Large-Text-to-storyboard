	But all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, 'Good evening, Mistress Miller; why are you crying so?' 'Alas!' answered the girl, 'I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it.' 'What will you give me,' said the manikin, 'if I do it for you?' 'My necklace,' said the girl. The little man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel, and 'whirr, whirr, whirr,' three turns, and the reel was full; then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was full too. And so it went on until the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold. By daybreak the King was already there, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy. He had the miller's daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued her life. The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door again opened, and the little man appeared, and said, 'What will you give me if I spin that straw into gold for you?' 'The ring on my finger,' answered the girl. The little man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.
