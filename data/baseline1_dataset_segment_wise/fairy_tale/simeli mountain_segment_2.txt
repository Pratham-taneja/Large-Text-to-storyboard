So he went up to it and said, 'Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,' and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said, 'Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;' and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow.
