In the evening she came to St. Joseph's little hut, who gave her roots for a thick soup. When it was ready, he likewise said to her, 'I am so hungry, give me some of thy food.' Then the child said, 'You may have your share.' Afterwards, when St. Joseph offered her his bed and wanted to lie on the straw, she replied, 'No, lie down in the bed, there is plenty of room for both of us.' St. Joseph took her in his arms and put her in the bed, and laid himself on the straw.
