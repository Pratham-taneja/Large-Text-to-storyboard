A tailor's apprentice was travelling about the world in search of work, and at one time he could find none, and his poverty was so great that he had not a farthing to live on. Presently he met a Jew on the road, and as he thought he would have a great deal of money about him, the tailor thrust God out of his heart, fell on the Jew, and said, 'Give me thy money, or I will strike thee dead.' Then said the Jew, 'Grant me my life, I have no money but eight farthings.' But the tailor said, 'Money thou hast; and it shall be produced,' and used violence and beat him until he was near death. And when the Jew was dying, the last words he said were, 'The bright sun will bring it to light,' and thereupon he died. The tailor's apprentice felt in his pockets and sought for money, but he found nothing but eight farthings, as the Jew had said. Then he took him up and carried him behind a clump of trees, and went onwards to seek work. After he had traveled about a long while, he got work in a town with a master who had a pretty daughter, with whom he fell in love, and he married her, and lived in good and happy wedlock.
