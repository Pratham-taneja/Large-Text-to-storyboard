She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, blear eyes, and red hair. 'Are you the King's daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises?' cried he. 'Ah,' she answered, 'this is not my form; human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that thou mayst know what I am like, look in the mirror it does not let itself be misled it will show thee my image as it is in truth.' She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief. Then said he, 'How canst thou be set free? I fear no danger.' She said, 'He who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape. Ah,' she added, 'so many have already gone to meet death for this, and thou art so young; I grieve that thou shouldst encounter such great danger.' 'Nothing can keep me from doing it,' said he, 'but tell me what I must do.' 'Thou shalt know everything,' said the King's daughter; 'when thou descendest the mountain on which the castle stands, a wild bull will stand below by a spring, and thou must fight with it, and if thou hast the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring out of it, which bears in its body a burning egg, and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk. The bird will not, however, let the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the ground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and melt even ice itself, and with it the crystal ball, and then all thy trouble will have been in vain.'
