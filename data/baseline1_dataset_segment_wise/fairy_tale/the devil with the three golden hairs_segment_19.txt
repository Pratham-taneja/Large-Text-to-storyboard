The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said, 'Who can help bad dreams?' 'What was the dream, then?' asked he, and was quite curious. 'I dreamt of a ferry-man who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released. What is the cause of it?' 'Ah! the fool,' answered the devil; 'when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free.' As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old serpent alone, and he slept until daybreak.
