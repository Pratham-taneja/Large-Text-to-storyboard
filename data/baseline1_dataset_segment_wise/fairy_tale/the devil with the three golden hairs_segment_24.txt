	At last the luck-child got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything. To the King he took what he had asked for, the devil's three golden hairs, and when the King saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, 'Now all the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter. But tell me, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from? this is tremendous wealth!' 'I was rowed across a river,' answered he, 'and got it there; it lies on the shore instead of sand.' 'Can I too fetch some of it?' said the King; and he was quite eager about it. 'As much as you like,' answered he. 'There is a ferry-man on the river; let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.' The greedy King set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across. The ferry-man came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang out. But from this time forth the King had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins. Perhaps he is ferrying still? If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him.
