	The boy set out with this letter; but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest. In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage. When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone. She started when she saw the boy, and said, 'Whence do you come, and whither are you going?' 'I come from the mill,' he answered, 'and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.' 'You poor boy,' said the woman, 'you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.' 'Let them come,' said the boy, 'I am not afraid; but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther:' and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.
