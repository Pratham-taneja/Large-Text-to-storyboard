	Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there? 'Ah,' said the old woman, 'it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in; he has to take a letter to the Queen.' The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death. Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King's daughter. Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.
