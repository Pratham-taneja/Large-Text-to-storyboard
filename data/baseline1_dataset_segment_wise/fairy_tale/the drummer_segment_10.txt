	The poor King's daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man. When evening came, she said, 'He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.' Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father's court. Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man's house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her. At length she heard the people saying, 'The wedding will take place to-morrow.' Then she said, 'I will try if I can win his heart back.'
