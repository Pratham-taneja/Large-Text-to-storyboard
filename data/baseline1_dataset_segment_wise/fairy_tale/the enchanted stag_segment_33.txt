	For two nights the baby's nurse saw a figure of the queen come into the room and take up her baby and nurse it. Then she told the king, and he determined to watch himself. The old stepmother, who acted as nurse to her ugly daughter, whom she tried to make the king believe was his wife, had said that the queen was too weak to see him, and never left her room. 'There cannot be two queens,' said the king to himself, 'so to-night I will watch in the nursery.' As soon as the figure came in and took up her baby, he saw it was his real wife, and caught her in his arms, saying, 'You are my own beloved wife, as beautiful as ever.'
