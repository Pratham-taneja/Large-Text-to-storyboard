There was once a poor man who had four sons, and when they were grown up, he said to them, 'My dear children, you must now go out into the world, for I have nothing to give you, so set out, and go to some distance and learn a trade, and see how you can make your way.' So the four brothers took their sticks, bade their father farewell, and went through the town-gate together. When they had travelled about for some time, they came to a cross-way which branched off in four different directions. Then said the eldest, 'Here we must separate, but on this day four years, we will meet each other again at this spot, and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes.'
