Below stood the golden cage; and the three golden apples, that had been lost, were lying close by its side. Then he thought to himself, 'It will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage;' so he opened the door and took hold of the bird, and put it into the golden cage. But it set up at once such a loud scream, that all the soldiers awoke; and they took him prisoner, and carried him before the king.
