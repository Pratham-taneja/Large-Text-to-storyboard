A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind it. Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an old man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and said, 'Why dost thou plague thyself with cutting wood, I will make thee rich, if thou wilt promise me what is standing behind thy mill?' 'What can that be but my apple-tree?' thought the miller, and said, 'Yes,' and gave a written promise to the stranger. He, however, laughed mockingly and said, 'When three years have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me,' and then he went. When the miller got home, his wife came to meet him and said, 'Tell me, miller, from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house? All at once every box and chest was filled; no one brought it in, and I know not how it happened.' He answered, 'It comes from a stranger who met me in the forest, and promised me great treasure. I, in return, have promised him what stands behind the mill; we can very well give him the big apple-tree for it.' 'Ah, husband,' said the terrified wife, 'that must have been the devil! He did not mean the apple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard.'
