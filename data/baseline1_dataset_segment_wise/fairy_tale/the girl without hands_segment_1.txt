	The miller's daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived through the three years in the fear of God and without sin. When therefore the time was over, and the day came when the Evil-one was to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle round herself with chalk. The devil appeared quite early, but he could not come near to her. Angrily, he said to the miller, 'Take all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to wash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.' The miller was afraid, and did so. The next morning the devil came again, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite clean. Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to the miller, 'Cut her hands off, or else I cannot get the better of her.' The miller was shocked and answered, 'How could I cut off my own child's hands?' Then the Evil-one threatened him and said, 'If thou dost not do it thou art mine, and I will take thee thyself.' The father became alarmed, and promised to obey him. So he went to the girl and said, 'My child, if I do not cut off both thine hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror I have promised to do it. Help me in my need, and forgive me the harm I do thee.' She replied, 'Dear father, do with me what you will, I am your child.' Thereupon she laid down both her hands, and let them be cut off. The devil came for the third time, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that after all they were quite clean. Then he had to give in, and had lost all right over her.
