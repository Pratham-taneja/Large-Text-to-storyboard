	When it grew dark the King came into the garden and brought a priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit. All three seated themselves beneath the tree and watched. At midnight the maiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and again ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood the angel in white garments. Then the priest went out to them and said, 'Comest thou from heaven or from earth? Art thou a spirit, or a human being?' She replied, 'I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but God.' The King said, 'If thou art forsaken by all the world, yet will I not forsake thee.' He took her with him into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good, he loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her, and took her to wife.
