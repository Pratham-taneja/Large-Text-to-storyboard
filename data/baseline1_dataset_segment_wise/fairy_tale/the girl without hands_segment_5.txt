Then said she to the Queen, 'I cannot have thee killed as the King commands, but here thou mayst stay no longer. Go forth into the wide world with thy child, and never come here again.' The poor woman tied her child on her back, and went away with eyes full of tears. She came into a great wild forest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house on which was a sign with the words, 'Here all dwell free.' A snow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, 'Welcome, Lady Queen,' and conducted her inside. Then they unbound the little boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might feed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed. Then said the poor woman, 'From whence knowest thou that I was a queen?' The white maiden answered, 'I am an angel sent by God, to watch over thee and thy child.' The Queen stayed seven years in the little house, and was well cared for, and by God's grace, because of her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more.
