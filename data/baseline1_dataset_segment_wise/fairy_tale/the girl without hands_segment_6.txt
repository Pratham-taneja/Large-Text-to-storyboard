	At last the King came home again from the war, and his first wish was to see his wife and the child. Then his aged mother began to weep and said, 'Thou wicked man, why didst thou write to me that I was to take those two innocent lives?' and she showed him the two letters which the Evil-one had forged, and then continued, 'I did as thou badest me,' and she showed the tokens, the tongue and eyes. Then the King began to weep for his poor wife and his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing, that the aged mother had compassion on him and said, 'Be at peace, she still lives; I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and took these tokens from it; but I bound the child to thy wife's back and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her promise never to come back here again, because thou wert so angry with her.' Then spoke the King, 'I will go as far as the sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have found again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they have not been killed, or died of hunger.'
