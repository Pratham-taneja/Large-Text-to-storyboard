During the whole of this time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him. At length he came into a great forest, and found therein the little house whose sign was, 'Here all dwell free.'

He answered, 'Soon shall I have travelled about for the space of seven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find them.' The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not take anything, and only wished to rest a little. Then he lay down to sleep, and put a handkerchief over his face.
