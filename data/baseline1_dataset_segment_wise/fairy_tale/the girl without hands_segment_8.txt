	Thereupon the angel went into the chamber where the Queen sat with her son, whom she usually called 'Sorrowful,' and said to her, 'Go out with thy child, thy husband hath come.' So she went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief fell from his face. Then said she, 'Sorrowful, pick up thy father's handkerchief, and cover his face again.' The child picked it up, and put it over his face again. The King in his sleep heard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief fall once more. But the child grew impatient, and said, 'Dear mother, how can I cover my father's face when I have no father in this world? I have learnt to say the prayer, 'Our Father, which art in Heaven,' thou hast told me that my father was in Heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild man like this? He is not my father.' When the King heard that, he got up, and asked who they were. Then said she, 'I am thy wife, and that is thy son, Sorrowful.' And he saw her living hands, and said, 'My wife had silver hands.' She answered, 'The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again;' and the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver hands, and showed them to him. Hereupon he knew for a certainty that it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed them, and was glad, and said, 'A heavy stone has fallen from off mine heart.' Then the angel of God gave them one meal with her, and after that they went home to the King's aged mother. There were great rejoicings everywhere, and the King and Queen were married again, and lived contentedly to their happy end.
