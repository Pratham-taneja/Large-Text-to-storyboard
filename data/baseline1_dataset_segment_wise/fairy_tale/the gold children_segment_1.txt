When they had had enough, the woman said, 'But husband, whence come all these riches?' 'Alas,' answered he, 'do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything; if I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune will fly.' 'Very good,' said she, 'if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything.' However, she was not in earnest; she never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty.

But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish. 'Listen,' said the fish, 'if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats; only be firm, for your life's sake don't reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!' 'I will take good care,' answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it. The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret. In an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut. 'Now you have got what you want,' said he; 'and we can gnaw at a bare bone again.' 'Ah,' said the woman, 'I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no peace.'
