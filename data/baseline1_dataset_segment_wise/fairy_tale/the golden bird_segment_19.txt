'You have certainly got what is best,' said he, 'but the Golden Horse also belongs to the maiden of the Golden Castle.' 'How shall I get it?' asked the youth.

And as soon as you have taken her hand swing her up on to the horse, and gallop away, and no one will be able to bring you back, for the horse runs faster than the wind.'
