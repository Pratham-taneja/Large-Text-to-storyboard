	But how did it fare with the poor Fox? Long afterwards the King's son was once again walking in the wood, when the Fox met him and said, 'You have everything now that you can wish for, but there is never an end to my misery, and yet it is in your power to free me,' and again he asked him with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and feet. So he did it, and scarcely was it done when the Fox was changed into a man, and was no other than the brother of the beautiful princess, who at last was freed from the magic charm which had been laid upon him. And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived.
