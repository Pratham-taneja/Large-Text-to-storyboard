This prophetic Brothers Grimm fairytale is about the supposedly dimmest and youngest of three brothers, who due to an act of kindness, is gifted a golden goose by an old man. The parable is about not being greedy-- trying to pluck a golden feather will only get you stuck in a parade of shame. The boy wins over the princess after many saves by the old man, and of course, they live happily ever after. Do not confuse this story with the far more iconic parable, The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs (that's a different lesson about greed). The Golden Goose was published in Grimm's collection, Children's and Household Tales (1812).
