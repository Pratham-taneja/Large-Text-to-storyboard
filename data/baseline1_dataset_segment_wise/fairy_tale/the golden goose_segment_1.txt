	There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling, and was despised, mocked, and put down on every occasion.

	It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.
