There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold her for seven thalers. On the way home he had to pass a pond, and already from afar he heard the frogs crying, 'Aik, aik, aik, aik.' 'Well,' said he to himself, 'they are talking without rhyme or reason, it is seven that I have received, not eight.' When he got to the water, he cried to them, 'Stupid animals that you are! Don't you know better than that? It is seven thalers and not eight.' The frogs, however, stood to their, 'aik aik, aik, aik.' 'Come, then, if you won't believe it, I can count it out to you.' And he took his money out of his pocket and counted out the seven thalers, always reckoning four and twenty groschen to a thaler. The frogs, however, paid no attention to his reckoning, but still cried, 'aik, aik, aik, aik.' 'What,' cried the peasant, quite angry, 'since you are determined to know better than I, count it yourselves,' and threw all the money into the water to them. He stood still and wanted to wait until they were done and had brought him his own again, but the frogs maintained their opinion and cried continually, 'aik, aik, aik, aik,' and besides that, did not throw the money out again. He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home. Then he abused the frogs and cried, 'You water-splashers, you thick-heads, you goggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt one's ears, but you cannot count seven thalers! Do you think I'm going to stand here till you get done?' And with that he went away, but the frogs still cried, 'aik, aik, aik, aik,' after him till he went home quite angry.
