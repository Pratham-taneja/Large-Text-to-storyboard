When therefore he got to the town with the meat, a great troop of dogs were gathered together in front of the gate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the meat, snuffed at it, and barked, 'Wow, wow, wow.' As there was no stopping him, the peasant said to him, 'Yes, yes, I know quite well that thou art saying, 'wow, wow, wow,' because thou wantest some of the meat; but I should fare badly if I were to give it to thee.' The dog, however, answered nothing but 'wow, wow.' 'Wilt thou promise not to devour it all then, and wilt thou go bail for thy companions?' 'Wow, wow, wow,' said the dog. 'Well, if thou insistest on it, I will leave it for thee; I know thee well, and know who is thy master; but this I tell thee, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with thee; thou must just bring it out to me.' Thereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again, the dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, 'wow, wow.'
