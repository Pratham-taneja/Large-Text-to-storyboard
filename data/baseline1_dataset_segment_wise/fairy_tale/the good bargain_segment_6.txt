	When the King heard of the peasant's words he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring the offender to him. The Jew ran to the peasant, 'You are to go at once to the lord King in the very clothes you have on.' 'I know what's right better than that,' answered the peasant, 'I shall have a new coat made first. Dost thou think that a man with so much money in his pocket is to go there in his ragged old coat?' The Jew, as he saw that the peasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if the King's anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the peasant his punishment, said, 'I will out of pure friendship lend thee a coat for the short time. What will people not do for love!' The peasant was contented with this, put the Jew's coat on, and went off with him.
