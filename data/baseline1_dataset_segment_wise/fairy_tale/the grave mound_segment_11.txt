	The Black One shook out all that was in the bag; the gold fell through, and the boot remained empty. 'Stupid Devil,' cried the soldier, 'it won't do! Didn't I say so at once? Go back again, and bring more.' The Devil shook his head, went, and in an hour's time came with a much larger bag under his arm. 'Now pour it in,' cried the soldier, 'but I doubt the boot won't be full.' The gold clinked as it fell, but the boot remained empty. The Devil looked in himself with his burning eyes, and convinced himself of the truth. 'You have shamefully big calves to your legs!' cried he, and made a wry face. 'Did you think,' replied the soldier, 'that I had a cloven foot like you? Since when have you been so stingy? See that you get more gold together, or our bargain will come to nothing!' The Wicked One went off again. This time he stayed away longer, and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders. He emptied it into the boot, which was just as far from being filled as before. He became furious, and was just going to tear the boot out of the soldier's hands, but at that moment the first ray of the rising sun broke forth from the sky, and the Evil Spirit fled away with loud shrieks. The poor soul was saved.
