On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, 'The hare relies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better of him. He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow, and he shall pay for what he has said.' So when the hedgehog reached home, he said to his wife, 'Wife, dress thyself quickly, thou must go out to the field with me.' 'What is going on, then?' said his wife. 'I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold louis-d'or and a bottle of brandy. I am to run a race with him, and thou must be present.' 'Good heavens, husband,' the wife now cried, 'art thou not right in thy mind, hast thou completely lost thy wits? What can make thee want to run a race with the hare?' 'Hold thy tongue, woman,' said the hedgehog, 'that is my affair. Don't begin to discuss things which are matters for men. Be off, dress thyself, and come with me.' What could the hedgehog's wife do? She was forced to obey him, whether she liked it or not.
