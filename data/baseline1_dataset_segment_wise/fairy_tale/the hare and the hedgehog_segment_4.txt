	Then they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife her place, and then walked up the field. When he reached the top, the hare was already there. 'Shall we start?' said the hare. 'Certainly,' said the hedgehog. 'Then both at once.' So saying, each placed himself in his own furrow. The hare counted, 'Once, twice, thrice, and away!' and went off like a whirlwind down the field. The hedgehog, however, only ran about three paces, and then he stooped down in the furrow, and stayed quietly where he was. When the hare therefore arrived in full career at the lower end of the field, the hedgehog's wife met him with the cry, 'I am here already!' The hare was shocked and wondered not a little, he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was calling to him, for the hedgehog's wife looked just like her husband. The hare, however, thought to himself, 'That has not been done fairly,' and cried, 'It must be run again, let us have it again.' And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so that he seemed to fly. But the hedgehog's wife stayed quietly in her place. So when the hare reached the top of the field, the hedgehog himself cried out to him, 'I am here already.' The hare, however, quite beside himself with anger, cried, 'It must be run again, we must have it again.' 'All right,' answered the hedgehog, 'for my part we'll run as often as you choose.' So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and the hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the hare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog or his wife said, 'I am here already.'
