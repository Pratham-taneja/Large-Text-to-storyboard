There was once a woman and her daughter who lived in a pretty garden with cabbages; and a little hare came into it, and during the winter time ate all the cabbages. Then says the mother to the daughter, 'Go into the garden, and chase the hare away.' The girl says to the little hare, 'Sh-sh, hare, you are still eating up all our cabbages.' Says the hare, 'Come, maiden, and seat yourself on my little hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut.' The girl will not do it. Next day the hare comes again and eats the cabbages, then says the mother to the daughter, 'Go into the garden, and drive the hare away.' The girl says to the hare, 'Sh-sh, little hare, you are still eating all the cabbages.' The little hare says, 'Maiden, seat thyself on my little hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut.' The maiden refuses. The third day the hare comes again, and eats the cabbages. On this the mother says to the daughter, 'Go into the garden, and hunt the hare away.' Says the maiden, 'Sh-sh, little hare, you are still eating all our cabbages.' Says the little hare, 'Come, maiden, seat thyself on my little hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut.' The girl seats herself on the little hare's tail, and then the hare takes her far away to his little hut, and says, 'Now cook green cabbage and millet-seed, and I will invite the wedding-guests.' Then all the wedding-guests assembled. (Who were the wedding-guests?) That I can tell you as another told it to me. They were all hares, and the crow was there as parson to marry the bride and bridegroom, and the fox as clerk, and the altar was under the rainbow.
