	The girl, however, was sad, for she was all alone. The little hare comes and says, 'Open the doors, open the doors, the wedding-guests are merry.' The bride says nothing, but weeps. The little hare goes away. The little hare comes back and says, 'Take off the lid, take off the lid, the wedding-guests are hungry.' The bride again says nothing, and weeps. The little hare goes away. The little hare comes back and says, 'Take off the lid, take off the lid, the wedding-guests are waiting.' Then the bride says nothing, and the hare goes away, but she dresses a straw-doll in her clothes, and gives her a spoon to stir with, and sets her by the pan with the millet-seed, and goes back to her mother. The little hare comes once more and says, 'Take off the lid, take off the lid,' and gets up, and strikes the doll on the head so that her cap falls off.
