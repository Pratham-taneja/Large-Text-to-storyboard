	After some time the boy became ill, and for eight days could not leave his bed; but as soon as he could get up again, the first thing he did was to take his food to Our Lady. The priest followed him, and heard him say, 'Dear God, do not take it amiss that I have not brought you anything for such a long time, for I have been ill and could not get up.' Then the image answered him and said, 'I have seen thy good-will, and that is enough for me. Next Sunday thou shalt go with me to the wedding.' The boy rejoiced at this, and repeated it to the priest, who begged him to go and ask the image if he, too, might be permitted to go. 'No,' answered the image, 'thou alone.' The priest wished to prepare him first, and give him the holy communion and the child was willing, and next Sunday, when the host came to him, he fell down and died, and was at the eternal wedding.
