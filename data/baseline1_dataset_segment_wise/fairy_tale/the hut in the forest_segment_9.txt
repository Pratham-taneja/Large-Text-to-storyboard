	'Pretty little hen, Pretty little cock, And beautiful brindled cow, What say ye to that?'

	'Duks,' said they. Then the girl went to the stove where the animals were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked their smooth feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled cow between her horns, and when, in obedience to the old man's orders, she had made ready some good soup, and the bowl was placed upon the table, she said, 'Am I to eat as much as I want, and the good animals to have nothing? Outside is food in plenty, I will look after them first.' So she went and brought some barley and stewed it for the cock and hen, and a whole armful of sweet-smelling hay for the cow. 'I hope you will like it, dear animals,' said she, 'and you shall have a refreshing draught in case you are thirsty.' Then she fetched in a bucketful of water, and the cock and hen jumped on to the edge of it and dipped their beaks in, and then held up their heads as the birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also took a hearty draught. When the animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by the old man, and ate what he had left. It was not long before the cock and the hen began to thrust their heads beneath their wings, and the eyes of the cow likewise began to blink. Then said the girl, 'Ought we not to go to bed?'
