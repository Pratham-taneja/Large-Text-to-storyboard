	The honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought, 'Ah! now that I have my purse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with hard work!' So on he went, up hill and down dale; and sang and jumped to his heart's content. Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to him, 'Whither away, merry brother? I see you do not carry many cares.' 'Why should I be sad?' answered the servant; 'I have enough; three years' wages are jingling in my pocket.' 'How much is your treasure?' the dwarf asked him. 'How much? Three farthings sterling, all told.' 'Look here,' said the dwarf, 'I am a poor needy man, give me your three farthings; I can work no longer, but you are young, and can easily earn your bread.'
