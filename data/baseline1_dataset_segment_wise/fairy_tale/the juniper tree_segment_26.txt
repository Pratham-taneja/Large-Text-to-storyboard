	Then she was light-hearted and joyous, and she put on the new red shoes, and danced and leaped into the house. 'Ah,' said she, 'I was so sad when I went out and now I am so light-hearted; that is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes!' 'Well,' said the woman, and sprang to her feet and her hair stood up like flames of fire, 'I feel as if the world were coming to an end! I, too, will go out and see if my heart feels lighter.' And as she went out at the door, crash! the bird threw down the millstone on her head, and she was entirely crushed by it. The father and Marlinchen heard what had happened and went out, and smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, there stood the little brother, and he took his father and Marlinchen by the hand, and all three were right glad, and they went into the house to dinner, and ate.
