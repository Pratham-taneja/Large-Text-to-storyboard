	One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, and her little daughter went up too, and said, 'Mother, give me an apple.' 'Yes, my child,' said the woman, and gave her a fine apple out of the chest, but the chest had a great heavy lid with a great sharp iron lock. 'Mother,' said the little daughter, 'is brother not to have one too?' This made the woman angry, but she said, 'Yes, when he comes out of school.' And when she saw from the window that he was coming, it was just as if the Devil entered into her, and she snatched at the apple and took it away again from her daughter, and said, 'Thou shalt not have one before thy brother.' Then she threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in at the door, and the Devil made her say to him kindly, 'My son, wilt thou have an apple?' and she looked wickedly at him. 'Mother,' said the little boy, 'how dreadful you look! Yes, give me an apple.' Then it seemed to her as if she were forced to say to him, 'Come with me,' and she opened the lid of the chest and said, 'Take out an apple for thyself,' and while the little boy was stooping inside, the Devil prompted her, and crash! she shut the lid down, and his head flew off and fell among the red apples. Then she was overwhelmed with terror, and thought, 'If I could but make them think that it was not done by me!' So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white handkerchief out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, and folded the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and she set him on a chair in front of the door, and put the apple in his hand.
