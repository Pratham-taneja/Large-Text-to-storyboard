	After this Marlinchen came into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing by the fire with a pan of hot water before her which she was constantly stirring round. 'Mother,' said Marlinchen, 'brother is sitting at the door, and he looks quite white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was quite frightened.' 'Go back to him,' said her mother, 'and if he will not answer thee, give him a box on the ear.' So Marlinchen went to him and said, 'Brother, give me the apple.' But he was silent, and she gave him a box on the ear, on which his head fell down. Marlinchen was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, 'Alas, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off!' and she wept and wept and could not be comforted. 'Marlinchen,' said the mother, 'what hast thou done? but be quiet and let no one know it; it cannot be helped now, we will make him into black-puddings.' Then the mother took the little boy and chopped him in pieces, put him into the pan and made him into black puddings; but Marlinchen stood by weeping and weeping, and all her tears fell into the pan and there was no need of any salt.
