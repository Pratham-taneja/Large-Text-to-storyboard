There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl; they were both young, and could not walk. And two richly-laden ships of his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just as he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they had gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town. In order to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went out to this field, and as he was walking forwards and backwards in it, a little black mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so sad, and what he was taking so much to heart. Then said the merchant, 'If thou couldst help me I would willingly tell thee.' 'Who knows?' replied the black dwarf. 'Perhaps, I can help thee.' Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field. 'Do not trouble thyself,' said the dwarf. 'If thou wilt promise to give me the first thing that rubs itself against thy leg when thou art at home again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years' time, thou shalt have as much money as thou wilt.' The merchant thought, 'What can that be but my dog?' and did not remember his little boy, so he said yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went home.
