	The King's son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, 'Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.' The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished. She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, 'I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.' The giant said, 'I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,' and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will. He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King's son refused it. 'Where the apple is, the ring must be also,' said the giant; 'if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.'
