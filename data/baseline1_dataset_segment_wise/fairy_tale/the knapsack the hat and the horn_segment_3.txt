Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack, spread it on the ground, and said, 'Little cloth, cover thyself,' and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there, and as hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen.

When they had eaten everything, the charcoal-burner smiled contentedly, and said, 'Hark thee, thy table-cloth has my approval; it would be a fine thing for me in this forest, where no one ever cooks me anything good. I will propose an exchange to thee; there in the corner hangs a soldier's knapsack, which is certainly old and shabby, but in it lie concealed wonderful powers; but, as I no longer use it, I will give it to thee for the table-cloth.'
