	'He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.'

	That was enough for him, and all inclination had departed from him, so he hastily descended the tree, and set out on his way home. The woman ran as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first. So when he entered the parlour, she put on an innocent look as if nothing had happened, and said, 'Well, have you brought a nice piece of wood for reels?' 'No,' said he, 'I see very well that winding won't do,' and told her what had happened to him in the forest, and from that time forth left her in peace about it. Neverthless after some time, the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house. 'Wife,' said he, 'it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled!' 'I'll tell you what,' said she, 'as we still don't come by any reel, go you up into the loft, and I will stand down below, and will throw the yarn up to you, and you will throw it down to me, and so we shall get a skein after all.' 'Yes, that will do,' said the man. So they did that, and when it was done, he said, 'The yarn is in skeins, now it must be boiled.' The woman was again distressed; She certainly said, 'Yes, we will boil it next morning early.' but she was secretly contriving another trick.
