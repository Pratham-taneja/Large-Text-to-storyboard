	After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said, 'Peasant, from whence comest thou? Hast thou come out of the water?' 'Yes, truly,' replied the peasant, 'I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.' Said the peasants, 'Are there any more there?' 'Oh, yes,' said he, 'more than I could do anything with.' Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the Mayor said, 'I come first.' So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried, 'We already see the sheep down below!' The Mayor pressed forward and said, 'I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I'll call you.' So he jumped in; splash! went the water; he made a sound as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.
