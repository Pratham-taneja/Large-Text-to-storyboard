	'The little louse has burnt herself, The little flea is weeping,

	The little door is creaking, The little broom is sweeping,

	The little cart is running, The little ash-heap is burning,

	The little tree is shaking itself.'

	'Oh, ho!' said the spring, 'then I will begin to flow,' and began to flow violently. And in the water everything was drowned, the girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little cart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little louse, all together.
