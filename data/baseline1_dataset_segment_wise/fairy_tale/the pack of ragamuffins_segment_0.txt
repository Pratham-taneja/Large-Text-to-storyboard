The cock once said to the hen, 'It is now the time when our nuts are ripe, so let us go to the hill together and for once eat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away.' 'Yes,' replied the hen, 'come, we will have some pleasure together.' Then they went away to the hill, and on it was a bright day they stayed till evening. Now I do not know whether it was that they had eaten till they were too fat, or whether they had become proud, but they would not go home on foot, and the cock had to build a little carriage of nut-shells. When it was ready, the little hen seated herself in it and said to the cock, 'Thou canst just harness thyself to it.' 'I like that!' said the cock, 'I would rather go home on foot than let myself be harnessed to it; no, that is not our bargain. I do not mind being coachman and sitting on the box, but drag it myself I will not.'
