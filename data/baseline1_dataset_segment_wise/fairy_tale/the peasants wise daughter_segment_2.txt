	When the King reached home again, he said to his wife, 'Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me? I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant's hut.' One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said, 'Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,' and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, 'Good God! where am I?' He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said, 'My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.' Tears rose to the King's eyes and he said, 'Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine,' and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living.
