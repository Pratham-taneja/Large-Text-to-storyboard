He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses, and then the man threatened: 'In five hours,' said he, 'I shall be back again, and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time, I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb.' The farmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the yearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread. The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to work with all his might. As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his haste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as the straw. He became aware of the misfortune too late; there was no repairing it. 'Ah,' cried he, 'now all is over with me! The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing; if he comes back and sees what I have done, he will kill me. Rather than that I will take my own life.'
