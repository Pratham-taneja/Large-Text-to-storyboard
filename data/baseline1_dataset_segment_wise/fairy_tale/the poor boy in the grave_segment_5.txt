	The boy had once heard the farmer's wife say, 'I have a pot with poison in it under my bed.' She, however, had only said that to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it. The boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all that was in it. 'I do not know,' said he, 'folks say death is bitter, but it tastes very sweet to me. It is no wonder that the farmer's wife has so often longed for death.' He seated himself in a little chair, and was prepared to die. But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food. 'It cannot have been poison,' thought he, 'but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes; that, no doubt, will be the true poison, and bring death to me.' It was, however, no poison for flies, but Hungarian wine. The boy got out the bottle, and emptied it. 'This death tastes sweet too,' said he, but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him, he thought his end was drawing near. 'I feel that I must die,' said he, 'I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.' He staggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly dug grave. He lost his senses more and more. In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept; when he heard the music, he fancied he was already in Paradise, until at length he lost all consciousness. The poor boy never awoke again; the heat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of life, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself.
