	The rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. As he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. He patted its neck, and said, 'Gently, Lisa,' but the horse only began new tricks. Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, 'I wish your neck was broken!' Directly he had said the words, down the horse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never moved again. And thus was his first wish fulfilled. As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot. 'I have still two wishes left,' said he, and comforted himself with that thought.
