	The rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse, and soon came up with the Lord. He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him. 'Yes,' said the Lord; 'if I ever come back again, I will do so.' Then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done? 'Yes,' said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted. So the Lord said to him, 'Ride home, then, and three wishes which you shall form, shall be fulfilled.'
