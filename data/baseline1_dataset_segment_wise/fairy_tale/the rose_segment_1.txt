	There was once a King's son who went out into the world, and he was full of thought and sad. He looked at the sky, which was so beautifully pure and blue, then he sighed, and said, 'How well must all be with one up there in heaven!' Then he saw a poor gray-haired man who was coming along the road towards him, and he spoke to him, and asked, 'How can I get to heaven?' The man answered, 'By poverty and humility. Put on my ragged clothes, wander about the world for seven years, and get to know what misery is, take no money, but if thou art hungry ask compassionate hearts for a bit of bread; in this way thou wilt reach heaven.'
