He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just going to fire, when the bird cried, 'Don't shoot; I will make it worth thy while not.' He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he surprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below to the surface of the water. When he had aimed at it, the fish cried, 'Don't shoot, and I will make it worth thy while.' He allowed it to dive down again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame. He fired and missed it, and the fox cried, 'You had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for me.' He did this; but then he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, 'Stop, and I will make it worth thy while.' The youth let him go, and then as it was evening, returned home.
