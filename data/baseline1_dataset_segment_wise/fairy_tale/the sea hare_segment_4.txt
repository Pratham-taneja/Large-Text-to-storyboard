	On the last day, he went with a heavy heart into the country, and met the fox. 'Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places,' said he; 'I let thee live, now advise me where I shall hide myself so that the King's daughter shall not discover me.' 'That's a hard task,' answered the fox, looking very thoughtful. At length he cried, 'I have it!' and went with him to a spring, dipped himself in it, and came out as a stall-keeper in the market, and dealer in animals. The youth had to dip himself in the water also, and was changed into a small sea-hare. The merchant went into the town, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons gathered together to see it. At length the King's daughter came likewise, and as she liked it very much, she bought it, and gave the merchant a good deal of money for it. Before he gave it over to her, he said to it, 'When the King's daughter goes to the window, creep quickly under the braids of he hair.' And now the time arrived when she was to search for him. She went to one window after another in turn, from the first to the eleventh, and did not see him. When she did not see him from the twelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it down with such violence that the glass in every window shivered into a thousand pieces, and the whole castle shook.
