Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other, 'Who has eaten something from my plate? Who has drunk out of my little glass? It was a human mouth.' And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against his mouth. Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother, and said, 'God grant that our sister may be here, and then we shall be free.' When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish, she came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their human form again. And they embraced and kissed each other, and went joyfully home.
