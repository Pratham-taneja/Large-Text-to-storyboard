	But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said 'What? what?' in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, 'Wade, wade through the water,' and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked 'Wat, wat, wat.' The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, 'Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?' So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again.
