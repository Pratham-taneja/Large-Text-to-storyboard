Then the Tall One took the one with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye they were on the enchanted rock. The Tall One immediately took the bandage from the other's eyes, and he did but look round, and the rock shivered into a thousand pieces.

When twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a malicious face, which seemed to say, 'Now he is mine!' for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off. But when she saw her in the prince's arms, she was alarmed, and said, 'Here is one who knows more than I do!' She dared not make any opposition, and was forced to give him her daughter. But she whispered in her ear, 'It is a disgrace to thee to have to obey common people, and that thou art not allowed to choose a husband to thine own liking.'
