	Half a league from the palace of the prince's father was a village near which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither the prince said to his wife, 'Do you know who I really am? I am no prince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that herd, is my father. We two shall have to set to work also, and help him.' Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the innkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night. So when she awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the innkeeper's wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted stockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great present, and said, 'If it were not for the sake of your husband I should have given you nothing at all!' Then the princess believed that he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and thought to herself, 'I have deserved this for my haughtiness and pride.' This lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for she had sores on her feet. And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was. 'Yes,' she answered, 'he is a swineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive a little bargain.' But they said, 'Just come with us, and we will take you to him,' and they took her up to the palace, and when she entered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment. But she did not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and said, 'I suffered much for thee and now thou, too, hast had to suffer for me.' And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has told you all this, wishes that he, too, had been present at it.
