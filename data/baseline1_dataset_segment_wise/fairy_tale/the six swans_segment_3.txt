	The poor girl thought, 'I can no longer stay here. I will go and seek my brothers.' And when night came, she ran away, and went straight into the forest. She walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping, until she could go no farther for weariness. Then she saw a forest-hut, and went into it, and found a room with six little beds, but she did not venture to get into one of them, but crept under one, and lay down on the hard ground, intending to pass the night there. Just before sunset, however, she heard a rustling, and saw six swans come flying in at the window. They alighted on the ground and blew at each other, and blew all the feathers off, and their swan's skins stripped off like a shirt. Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed. The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was of short duration. 'Here canst thou not abide,' they said to her. 'This is a shelter for robbers, if they come home and find thee, they will kill thee.' 'But can you not protect me?' asked the little sister. 'No,' they replied, 'only for one quarter of an hour each evening can we lay aside our swan's skins and have during that time our human form; after that, we are once more turned into swans.' The little sister wept and said, 'Can you not be set free?' 'Alas, no,' they answered, 'the conditions are too hard! For six years thou mayst neither speak nor laugh, and in that time thou must sew together six little shirts of starwort for us. And if one single word falls from thy lips, all thy work will be lost.' And when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over, and they flew out of the window again as swans.
