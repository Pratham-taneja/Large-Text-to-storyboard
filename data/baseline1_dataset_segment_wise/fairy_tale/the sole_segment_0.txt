None of them turned aside for the others, but all swam to the right or the left as they fancied, or darted between those who wanted to stay together, or got into their way; and a strong one gave a weak one a blow with its tail, which drove it away, or else swallowed it up without more ado. 'How delightful it would be,' said they, 'if we had a king who enforced law and justice among us!' and they met together to choose for their ruler, the one who could cleave through the water most quickly, and give help to the weak ones.
