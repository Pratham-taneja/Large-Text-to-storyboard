	And now the scolar was about to return to his father, but the spirit cried very piteously, 'Ah, do let me out! ah, do let me out!' 'No,' answered the scholar, 'not a second time! He who has once tried to take my life shall not be set free by me, now that I have caught him again.' 'If thou wilt set me free,' said the spirit, 'I will give thee so much that thou wilt have plenty all the days of thy life.' 'No,' answered the boy, 'thou wouldst cheat me as thou didst the first time.' 'Thou art playing away with thy own good luck,' said the spirit; 'I will do thee no harm but will reward thee richly.' The scholar thought, 'I will venture it, perhaps he will keep his word, and anyhow he shall not get the better of me.' Then he took out the cork, and the spirit rose up from the bottle as he had done before, stretched himself out and became as big as a giant. 'Now thou shalt have thy reward,' said he, and handed the scholar a little bag just like a plaster, and said, 'If thou spreadest one end of this over a wound it will heal, and if thou rubbest steel or iron with the other end it will be changed into silver.' 'I must just try that,' said the scholar, and went to a tree, tore off the bark with his axe, and rubbed it with one end of the plaster. It immediately closed together and was healed. 'Now, it is all right,' he said to the spirit, 'and we can part.' The spirit thanked him for his release, and the boy thanked the spirit for his present, and went back to his father.
