	The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the fire, and once more began his old song, 'If I could but shudder.' When midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for awhile, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before him. 'Hollo!' cried he, 'another half belongs to this. This is too little!' Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. 'Wait,' said he, 'I will just blow up the fire a little for thee.' When he had done that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a frightful man was sitting in his place. 'That is no part of our bargain,' said the youth, 'the bench is mine.' The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men's legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said 'Hark you, can I join you?' 'Yes, if thou hast any money.' 'Money enough,' replied he, 'but your balls are not quite round.' Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round. 'There, now, they will roll better!' said he. 'Hurrah! Now it goes merrily!' He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the King came to inquire after him. 'How has it fared with you this time?' asked he. 'I have been playing at nine-pins,' he answered, 'and have lost a couple of farthings.' 'Hast thou not shuddered then?' 'Eh, what?' said he, 'I have made merry. If I did but know what it was to shudder!'
