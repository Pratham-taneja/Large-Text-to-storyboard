	The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly, 'If I could but shudder.' When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin. Then said he, 'Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,' and he beckoned with his finger, and cried 'Come, little cousin, come.' They placed the coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. 'Stop,' said he, 'I will warm thee a little,' and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man's face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself 'When two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,' and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, 'See, little cousin, have I not warmed thee?' The dead man, however, got up and cried, 'Now will I strangle thee.'
