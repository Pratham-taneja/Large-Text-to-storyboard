	Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. He was old, however, and had a long white beard. 'Thou wretch,' cried he, 'thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder, for thou shalt die.' 'Not so fast,' replied the youth. 'If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.' 'I will soon seize thee,' said the fiend. 'Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as thou art, and perhaps even stronger.' 'We shall see,' said the old man. 'If thou art stronger, I will let thee goâ-come, we will try.' Then he led him by dark passages to a smith's forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. 'I can do better than that,' said the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and struck the old man's beard in with it. 'Now I have thee,' said the youth. 'Now it is thou who will have to die.' Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, and he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. 'Of these,' said he, 'one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third is thine.' In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared; the youth, therefore, was left in darkness. 'I shall still be able to find my way out,' said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire. Next morning the King came and said 'Now thou must have learnt what shuddering is?' 'No,' he answered; 'what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.' 'Then,' said the King, 'thou hast delivered the castle, and shalt marry my daughter.' 'That is all very well,' said he, 'but still I do not know what it is to shudder.'
