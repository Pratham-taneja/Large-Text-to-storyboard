And at last she was angry at this. Her waiting-maid said, 'I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.' She went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucketful of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him. When this was done, he woke up and cried 'Oh, what makes me shudder so?â-what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!'
