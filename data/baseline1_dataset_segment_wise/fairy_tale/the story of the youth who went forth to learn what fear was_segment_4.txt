	The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time, 'What do you want here?â-speak if thou art an honest fellow, or I will throw thee down the steps!' The sexton thought, 'he can't intend to be as bad as his words,' uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton's wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked, 'Dost thou not know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before thou didst.' 'No, I don't know,' replied the boy, 'but some one was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs, just go there and you will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.' The woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.
