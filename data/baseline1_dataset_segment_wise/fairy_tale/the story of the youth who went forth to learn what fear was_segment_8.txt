A waggoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked, 'Who are you?' 'I don't know,' answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked, 'From whence comest thou?' 'I know not.' 'Who is thy father?' 'That I may not tell thee.' 'What is it that thou art always muttering between thy teeth.' 'Ah,' replied the youth, 'I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me how to do it.' 'Give up thy foolish chatter,' said the waggoner. 'Come, go with me, I will see about a place for thee.' The youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the room the youth again said quite loudly, 'If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!' The host who heard this, laughed and said, 'If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.' 'Ah, be silent,' said the hostess, 'so many inquisitive persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.'
