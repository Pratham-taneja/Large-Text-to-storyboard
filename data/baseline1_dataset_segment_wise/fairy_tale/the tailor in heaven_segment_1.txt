	When the Lord and master came back again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing. He asked Saint Peter what had become of the stool, but he did not know. Then he asked if he had let anyone come in. 'I know of no one who has been here,' answered Peter, 'but a lame tailor, who is still sitting behind the door.' Then the Lord had the tailor brought before him, and asked him if he had taken away the stool, and where he had put it? 'Oh, Lord,' answered the tailor joyously, 'I threw it in my anger down to earth at an old woman whom I saw stealing two veils at the washing.' 'Oh, thou knave,' said the Lord, 'were I to judge as thou judgest, how dost thou think thou couldst have escaped so long? I should long ago have had no chairs, benches, seats, nay, not even an oven-fork, but should have thrown everything down at the sinners. Henceforth thou canst stay no longer in heaven, but must go outside the door again. Then go where thou wilt. No one shall give punishment here, but I alone, the Lord.'
