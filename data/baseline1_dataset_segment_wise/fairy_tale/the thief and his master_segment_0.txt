Hans wished to put his son to learn a trade, so he went into the church and prayed to our Lord God to know which would be most advantageous for him. Then the clerk got behind the altar, and said, 'Thieving, thieving.' On this Hans goes back to his son, and tells him he is to learn thieving, and that the Lord God had said so. So he goes with his son to seek a man who is acquainted with thieving. They walk a long time and come into a great forest, where stands a little house with an old woman in it. Hans says, 'Do you know of a man who is acquainted with thieving?' 'You can learn that here quite well,' says the woman, 'my son is a master of it.' So he speaks with the son, and asks if he knows thieving really well? The master-thief says, 'I will teach him well. Come back when a year is over, and then if you recognize your son, I will take no payment at all for teaching him; but if you don't know him, you must give me two hundred thalers.'
