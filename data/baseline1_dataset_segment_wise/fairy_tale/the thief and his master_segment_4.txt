Hereupon the son says to his father, 'I will change myself into a large greyhound, and then you can earn a great deal of money by me.' Then the gentleman calls from the carriage, 'My man, will you sell your dog?' 'Yes,' says the father. 'How much do you want for it?' 'Thirty thalers.' 'Eh, man, that is a great deal, but as it is such a very fine dog I will have it.' The gentleman takes it into his carriage, but when they have driven a little farther the dog springs out of the carriage through the window, and goes back to his father, and is no longer a greyhound.
