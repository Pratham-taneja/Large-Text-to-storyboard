The others wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that did no good; he tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was thickest. The second also behaved very strangely; he rubbed his eyes, and said to the others, 'Comrades, what is the matter? I don't see at all. Will one of you lead me, so that I do not fall.' Then with difficulty they travelled on till evening, when they reached another inn. They went into the bar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money. The one with the thief's hand walked round about him, made a sudden movement twice with his arm, and at last when the stranger turned away, he snatched at the pile of money, and took a handful from it. One of them saw this, and said, 'Comrade, what art thou about? Thou must not steal shame on thee!' 'Eh,' said he, 'but how can I stop myself? My hand twitches, and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.'
