	Then Simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad, and said, 'I am to take home the most beautiful woman!' 'Oh,' answered the toad, 'the most beautiful woman! She is not at hand at the moment, but still thou shalt have her.' She gave him a yellow turnip which had been hollowed out, to which six mice were harnessed. Then Simpleton said quite mournfully, 'What am I to do with that?' The toad answered, 'Just put one of my little toads into it.' Then he seized one at random out of the circle, and put her into the yellow coach, but hardly was she seated inside it than she turned into a wonderfully beautiful maiden, and the turnip into a coach, and the six mice into horses. So he kissed her, and drove off quickly with the horses, and took her to the King. His brothers came afterwards; they had given themselves no trouble at all to seek beautiful girls, but had brought with them the first peasant women they chanced to meet. When the King saw them he said, 'After my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son.' But the two eldest deafened the King's ears afresh with their clamour, 'We cannot consent to Simpleton's being King,' and demanded that the one whose wife could leap through a ring which hung in the centre of the hall should have the preference. They thought, 'The peasant women can do that easily; they are strong enough, but the delicate maiden will jump herself to death.' The aged King agreed likewise to this. Then the two peasant women jumped, and jumped through the ring, but were so stout that they fell, and their coarse arms and legs broke in two. And then the pretty maiden whom Simpleton had brought with him, sprang, and sprang through as lightly as a deer, and all opposition had to cease. So he received the crown, and has ruled wisely for a length of time.
