An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father, 'Hark thee, my son, I can get nothing into thy head, let me try as I will. Thou must go from hence, I will give thee into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with thee.' The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked, 'Now, my son, what hast thou learnt?' 'Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.' 'Lord have mercy on us!' cried the father; 'is that all thou hast learnt? I will send thee into another town, to another master.' The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back the father again asked, 'My son, what hast thou learnt?' He answered, 'Father, I have learnt what the birds say.' Then the father fell into a rage and said, 'Oh, thou lost man, thou hast spent the precious time and learnt nothing; art thou not ashamed to appear before mine eyes? I will send thee to a third master, but if thou learnest nothing this time also, I will no longer be thy father.' The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired, 'My son, what hast thou learnt?' he answered, 'Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.' Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said, 'This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.' They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and the tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.
