	Once, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone, and hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock of paper, called her step-daughter, and said, 'Here, put on this dress and go out into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of strawberries,â-I have a fancy for some.' 'Good heavens!' said the girl, 'no strawberries grow in winter! The ground is frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything. And why am I to go in this paper frock? It is so cold outside that one's very breath freezes! The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns will tear it off my body.' 'Wilt thou contradict me again?' said the stepmother, 'See that thou goest, and do not show thy face again until thou hast the basketful of strawberries!' Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, 'This will last thee the day,' and thought, 'Thou wilt die of cold and hunger outside, and wilt never be seen again by me.'
