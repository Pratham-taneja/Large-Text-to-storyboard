'Ah,' she answered, 'I am to look for a basketful of strawberries, and am not to go home until I can take them with me.' When she had eaten her bread, they gave her a broom and said, 'Sweep away the snow at the back door with it.'

The third said, 'My gift is, that a king shall come and take her to wife.'
