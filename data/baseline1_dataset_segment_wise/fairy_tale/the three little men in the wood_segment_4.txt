In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much. When she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once fell from her mouth. Thereupon she related what had happened to her in the wood, but with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell from her mouth, until very soon the whole room was covered with them. 'Now look at her arrogance,' cried the step-sister, 'to throw about gold in that way!' but she was secretly envious of it, and wanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries. The mother said, 'No, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, thou mightest die of cold.' However, as her daughter let her have no peace, the mother at last yielded, made her a magnificent dress of fur, which she was obliged to put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake with her.
