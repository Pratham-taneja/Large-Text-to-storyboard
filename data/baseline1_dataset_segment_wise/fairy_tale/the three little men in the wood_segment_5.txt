	The girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house. The three little elves peeped out again, but she did not greet them, and without looking round at them and without speaking to them, she went awkwardly into the room, seated herself by the stove, and began to eat her bread-and-butter and cake. 'Give us some of it,' cried the little men; but she replied, 'There is not enough for myself, so how can I give it away to other people?' When she had done eating, they said, 'There is a broom for thee, sweep all clean for us outside by the back-door.' 'Humph! Sweep for yourselves,' she answered, 'I am not your servant.' When she saw that they were not going to give her anything, she went out by the door. Then the little men said to each other, 'What shall we give her as she is so naughty, and has a wicked envious heart, that will never let her do a good turn to any one?' The first said, 'I grant that she may grow uglier every day.' The second said, 'I grant that at every word she says, a toad shall spring out of her mouth.' The third said, 'I grant that she may die a miserable death.' The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home. And when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood, with every word she said, a toad sprang out of her mouth, so that every one was seized with horror of her.
