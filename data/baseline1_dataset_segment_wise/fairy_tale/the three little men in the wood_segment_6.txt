When it was boiled, she flung it on the poor girl's shoulder, and gave her an axe in order that she might go on the frozen river, cut a hole in the ice, and rinse the yarn. She was obedient, went thither and cut a hole in the ice; and while she was in the midst of her cutting, a splendid carriage came driving up, in which sat the King. The carriage stopped, and the King asked,'My child, who are thou, and what art thou doing here?' 'I am a poor girl, and I am rinsing yarn.' Then the King felt compassion, and when he saw that she was so very beautiful, he said to her, 'Wilt thou go away with me?' 'Ah, yes, with all my heart,' she answered, for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister.
