	'What does little baby mine?'

	He answered,

	'Sleepeth in her cradle fine.'

	Then she went upstairs in the form of the Queen, nursed the baby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away again down the gutter in the shape of a duck. She came thus for two nights; on the third, she said to the scullion, 'Go and tell the King to take his sword and swing it three times over me on the threshold.' Then the scullion ran and told this to the King, who came with his sword and swung it thrice over the spirit, and at the third time, his wife stood before him strong, living, and healthy as she had been before. Thereupon the King was full of great joy, but he kept the Queen hidden in a chamber until the Sunday, when the baby was to be christened. And when it was christened he said, 'What does a person deserve who drags another out of bed and throws him in the water?' 'The wretch deserves nothing better,' answered the old woman, 'than to be taken and put in a barrel stuck full of nails, and rolled down hill into the water.' 'Then,' said the King, 'Thou hast pronounced thine own sentence;' and he ordered such a barrel to be brought, and the old woman to be put into it with her daughter, and then the top was hammered on, and the barrel rolled down hill until it went into the river.
