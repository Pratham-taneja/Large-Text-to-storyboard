	The King had a daughter who was very beautiful, but she was also very strange. She had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died first. 'If he loves me with all his heart,' said she, 'of what use will life be to him afterwards?' On her side she would do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave with him. This strange oath had up to this time frightened away all wooers, but the youth became so charmed with her beauty that he cared for nothing, but asked her father for her. 'But dost thou know what thou must promise?' said the King. 'I must be buried with her,' he replied, 'if I outlive her, but my love is so great that I do not mind the danger.' Then the King consented, and the wedding was solemnized with great splendour.
