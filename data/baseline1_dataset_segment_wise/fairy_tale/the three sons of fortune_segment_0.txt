A father once called his three sons before him, and he gave to the first a cock, to the second a scythe, and to the third a cat. 'I am already aged,' said he, 'my death is nigh, and I have wished to take thought for you before my end; money I have not, and what I now give you seems of little worth, but all depends on your making a sensible use of it. Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown, and your fortune is made.'
