	The cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace, and killed so many that they could not be counted. At last she grew warm with the work and thirsty, so she stood still, lifted up her head and cried, 'Mew. Mew!' When they heard this strange cry, the King and all his people were frightened, and in their terror ran all at once out of the palace. Then the King took counsel what was best to be done; at last it was determined to send a herald to the cat, and demand that she should leave the palace, or if not, she was to expect that force would be used against her. The councillors said, 'Rather will we let ourselves be plagued with the mice, for to that misfortune we are accustomed, than give up our lives to such a monster as this.' A noble youth, therefore, was sent to ask the cat 'whether she would peaceably quit the castle?' But the cat, whose thirst had become still greater, merely answered, 'Mew! Mew!' The youth understood her to say, 'Most certainly not! most certainly not!' and took this answer to the King. 'Then,' said the councillors, 'she shall yield to force.' Cannon were brought out, and the palace was soon in flames. When the fire reached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out of the window; but the besiegers did not leave off until the whole palace was shot down to the ground.
