As he still was not there by the fourth day, she said, 'Some accident has assuredly befallen him. I will go out and seek him, and will not come back until I have found him.' She packed up three of her most beautiful dresses, one embroidered with bright stars, the second with silver moons, the third with golden suns, tied up a handful of jewels in her handkerchief, and set out.

At last she hired herself to a farmer as a cow-herd, and buried her dresses and jewels beneath a stone.
