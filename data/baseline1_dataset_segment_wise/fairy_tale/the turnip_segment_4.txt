	The student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said, 'Blessed be the hour in which I have found thee! May not I also enter the sack for a while?' He who was above replied as if unwillingly, 'For a short time I will let you get into it, if you reward me and give me good words; but you must wait an hour longer, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it.' When the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged to be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was so very great. So he who was above pretended at last to yield, and said, 'In order that I may come forth from the house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and then you shall enter it.' So the student let the sack down, untied it, and set him free, and then cried, 'Now draw me up at once,' and was about to get into the sack. 'Halt!' said the other, 'that won't do,' and took him by the head and put him upside down into the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up the tree by the rope. Then he swung him in the air and said, 'How goes it with thee, my dear fellow? Behold, already thou feelest wisdom coming, and art gaining valuable experience. Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser.' Thereupon he mounted the student's horse and rode away, but in an hour's time sent some one to let the student out again.
