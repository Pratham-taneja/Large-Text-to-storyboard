Then she said, 'my dearest Benjamin, thy father has had these coffins made for thee and for thy eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into the world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.' And as she wept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, 'Weep not, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.' But she said, 'Go forth into the forest with thy eleven brothers, and let one sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep watch, looking towards the tower here in the castle. If I give birth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may venture to come back, but if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red flag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the good God protect you. And every night I will rise up and pray for youâ-in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat.'
