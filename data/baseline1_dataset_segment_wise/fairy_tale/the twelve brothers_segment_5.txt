	The little daughter which their mother the Queen had given birth to, was now grown up; she was good of heart, and fair of face, and had a golden star on her forehead. Once, when it was the great washing, she saw twelve men's shirts among the things, and asked her mother, 'To whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far too small for father?' Then the Queen answered with a heavy heart, 'Dear child, these belong to thy twelve brothers.' Said the maiden, 'Where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard of them?' She replied, 'God knows where they are, they are wandering about the world.' Then she took the maiden and opened the chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the shavings, and pillows for the head. 'These coffins,' said she, 'were destined for thy brothers, but they went away secretly before thou wert born,' and she related to her how everything had happened; then said the maiden, 'Dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek my brothers.'
