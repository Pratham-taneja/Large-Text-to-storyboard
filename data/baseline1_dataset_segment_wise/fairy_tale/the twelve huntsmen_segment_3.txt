	The King, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to the King, 'Thou thinkest thou hast twelve huntsmen?' 'Yes,' said the King, 'they are twelve huntsmen.' The lion continued, 'Thou art mistaken, they are twelve girls.' The King said, 'That cannot be true! How wilt thou prove that to me?' 'Oh, just let some peas be strewn in thy ante-chamber,' answered the lion, 'and then thou wilt soon see it. Men have a firm step, and when they walk over the peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.' The King was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.
