	There was, however, a servant of the King's who favored the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said, 'The lion wants to make the King believe that you are girls.' Then the King's daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens, 'Put on some strength, and step firmly on the peas.' So next morning when the King had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the King said to the lion, 'Thou hast lied to me, they walk just like men.' The lion said, 'They have got to know that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber some day, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.' The King liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.
