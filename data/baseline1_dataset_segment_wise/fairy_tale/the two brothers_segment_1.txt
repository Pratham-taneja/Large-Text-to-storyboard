	The goldsmith was crafty and cunning, and knew very well what kind of a bird it was. He called his wife and said, 'Roast me the gold bird, and take care that none of it is lost. I have a fancy to eat it all myself.' The bird, however, was no common one, but of so wondrous a kind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a piece of gold beneath his pillow. The woman made the bird ready, put it on the spit, and let it roast. Now it happened that while it was at the fire, and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on account of some other work, the two children of the poor broom-maker ran in, stood by the spit and turned it round once or twice. And as at that very moment two little bits of the bird fell down into the dripping-tin, one of the boys said, 'We will eat these two little bits; I am so hungry, and no one will ever miss them.' Then the two ate the pieces, but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were eating something and said, 'What have ye been eating?' 'Two little morsels which fell out of the bird,' answered they. 'That must have been the heart and the liver,' said the woman, quite frightened, and in order that her husband might not miss them and be angry, she quickly killed a young cock, took out his heart and liver, and put them beside the golden bird. When it was ready, she carried it to the goldsmith, who consumed it all alone, and left none of it. Next morning, however, when he felt beneath his pillow, and expected to bring out the piece of gold, no more gold pieces were there than there had always been.
