	'Dear huntsman, do but let me live, Two little ones I, too, will give.'

	And he brought his little ones to them, and now the huntsmen had two lions, two bears, two wolves, two foxes, and two hares, who followed them and served them. In thu meantime their hunger was not appeased by this, and they said to the foxes, 'Hark ye, cunning fellows, provide us with something to eat. You are crafty and deep.' They replied, 'Not far from here lies a village, from which we have already brought many a fowl; we will show you the way there.' So they went into the village, bought themselves something to eat, had some food given to their beasts, and then travelled onwards. The foxes, however, knew their way very well about the district and where the poultry-yards were, and were able to guide the huntsmen.
