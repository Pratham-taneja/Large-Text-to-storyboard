So they separated, and at the same time came the watchmen from the one door and from the other, and announced that the young King and the animals had returned from the chase. The King said, 'It is not possible, the gates lie quite a mile apart.' In the meantime, however, the two brothers entered the courtyard of the palace from opposite sides, and both mounted the steps. Then the King said to the daughter, 'Say which is thy husband. Each of them looks exactly like the other, I cannot tell.' Then she was in great distress, and could not tell; but at last she remembered the necklace which she had given to the animals, and she sought for and found her little golden clasp on the lion, and she cried in her delight, 'He who is followed by this lion is my true husband'. Then the young King laughed and said, 'Yes, he is the right one,' and they sat down together to table, and ate and drank, and were merry. At night when the young King went to bed, his wife said, 'Why hast thou for these last nights always laid a two-edged sword in our bed? I thought thou hadst a wish to kill me.' Then he knew how true his brother had been.
