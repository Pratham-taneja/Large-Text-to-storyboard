	And now the two children ran about the forest, and sought the way home again, but could not find it, and only lost themselves more and more. At length they met with a huntsman, who asked, 'To whom do you children belong?' 'We are the poor broom-maker's boys,' they replied, and they told him that their father would not keep them any longer in the house because a piece of gold lay every morning under their pillows. 'Come,' said the huntsman, 'that is nothing so very bad, if at the same time you keep honest, and are not idle.' As the good man liked the children, and had none of his own, he took them home with him and said, 'I will be your father, and bring you up till you are big.' They learnt huntsmanship from him, and the piece of gold which each of them found when he awoke, was kept for them by him in case they should need it in the future.
