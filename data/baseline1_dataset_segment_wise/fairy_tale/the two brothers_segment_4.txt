	When they were grown up, their foster-father one day took them into the forest with him, and said, 'To-day shall you make your trial shot, so that I may release you from your apprenticeship, and make you huntsmen.' They went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long time, but no game appeared. The huntsman, however, looked above him and saw a covey of wild geese flying in the form of a triangle, and said to one of them, 'Shoot me down one from each corner.' He did it, and thus accomplished his trial shot. Soon after another covey came flying by in the form of the figure two, and the huntsman bade the other also bring down one from each corner, and his trial shot was likewise successful. 'Now,' said the foster-father, 'I pronounce you out of your apprenticeship; you are skilled huntsmen.' Thereupon the two brothers went forth together into the forest, and took counsel with each other and planned something. And in the evening when they had sat down to supper, they said to their foster-father, 'We will not touch food, or take one mouthful, until you have granted us a request.' Said he, 'What, then, is your request?' They replied, 'We have now finished learning, and we must prove ourselves in the world, so allow us to go away and travel.' Then spake the old man joyfully, 'You talk like brave huntsmen, that which you desire has been my wish; go forth, all will go well with you.' Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.
