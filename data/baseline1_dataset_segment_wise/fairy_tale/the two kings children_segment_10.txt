	When the mother came to the place, there was a large fish-pond, and in the midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the water, and it was quite merry. She wanted to catch the fish, but she could not. Then she was very angry, and drank up the whole pond in order to catch the fish, but it made her so ill that she was forced to vomit, and vomited the whole pond out again. Then she cried, 'I see very well that nothing can be done now,' and said that now they might come back to her. Then the King's daughter went back again, and the Queen gave her daughter three walnuts, and said, 'With these thou canst help thyself when thou art in thy greatest need.' So the young folks went once more away together. And when they had walked quite ten miles, they arrived at the castle from whence the King's son came, and close by it was a village. When they reached it, the King's son said, 'Stay here, my dearest, I will just go to the castle, and then will I come with a carriage and with attendants to fetch thee.'
