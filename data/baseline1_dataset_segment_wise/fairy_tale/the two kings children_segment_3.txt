'No,' said the two eldest, 'We will not take it to him; the one by whom he last watched, can take him something.' Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat. When she got into the forest, she asked him how he was getting on? 'Oh,' said he, 'I am getting on very badly.' Then she said he was to come and just eat a little. 'Nay,' said he, 'I cannot do that, I shall still have to die, so I will eat no more.' Then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him just to try, that he came and ate something. When he had eaten something she said, 'I will comb thy hair a while, and then thou wilt feel happier.'
