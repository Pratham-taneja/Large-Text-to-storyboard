	'Sew me the seam, Draw me the thread, Spread it over with pitch, Knock the nail on the head.'

	The shoemaker, however, could not endure a joke; he pulled a face as if he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize the tailor by the throat. But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said, 'No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down.' The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began to clear away. He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, 'I spoke civilly to you; one speaks well after much drinking, but not after much thirst. Shall we travel together?' 'All right,' answered the tailor, 'if only it suits you to go into a big town where there is no lack of work.' 'That is just where I want to go,' answered the shoemaker. 'In a small nest there is nothing to earn, and in the country, people like to go barefoot.' They travelled therefore onwards together, and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow.
