At this moment he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him. 'You come just at the right moment,' said he, and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck. On this an old duck which was hidden among the reeds, began to scream loudly, and swam to him with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare her dear children. 'Canst thou not imagine,' said she, 'how thy mother would mourn if any one wanted to carry thee off, and give thee thy finishing stroke?' 'Only be quiet,' said the good-tempered tailor, 'thou shalt keep thy children,' and put the prisoner back into the water.
