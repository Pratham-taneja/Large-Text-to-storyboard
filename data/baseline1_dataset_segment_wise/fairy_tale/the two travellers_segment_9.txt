The first thing that comes across me and is even half edible will have to suffer for it.' In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him. 'Halt, halt!' cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg. 'I don't know if thou art good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great choice. I must cut thy head off, and roast thee.' 'Don't do that,' replied the stork; 'I am a sacred bird which brings mankind great profit, and no one does me an injury. Leave me my life, and I may do thee good in some other way.' 'Well, be off, Cousin Longlegs,' said the tailor. The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away.
