	The old King was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had plotted against his life. So he summoned the court together and had sentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot. And once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no evil, the King's huntsman had to go with him, and when they were quite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said to him, 'Dear huntsman, what ails you?' The huntsman said, 'I cannot tell you, and yet I ought.' Then the prince said, 'Say openly what it is, I will pardon you.' 'Alas!' said the huntsman, 'I am to shoot you dead, the King has ordered me to do it.' Then the prince was shocked, and said, 'Dear huntsman, let me live; there, I give you my royal garments; give me your common ones in their stead.' The huntsman said, 'I will willingly do that, indeed I should not have been able to shoot you.' Then they exchanged clothes, and the huntsman returned home; the prince, however, went further into the forest. After a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the King for his youngest son, which were sent by the three Kings who had slain their enemies with the prince's sword, and maintained their people with his bread, and who wished to show their gratitude for it. The old King then thought, 'Can my son have been innocent?' and said to his people, 'Would that he were still alive, how it grieves me that I have suffered him to be killed!' 'He still lives,' said the huntsman, 'I could not find it in my heart to carry out your command,' and told the King how it had happened. Then a stone fell from the King's heart, and he had it proclaimed in every country that his son might return and be taken into favour again.
