In former days every sound still had its meaning and application. When the smith's hammer resounded, it cried, 'Strike away! strike away.' When the carpenter's plane grated, it said, 'Here goes! here goes.' If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, 'Help, Lord God! help, Lord God!' And if the miller was a cheat and happened to leave the mill, it spoke high German, and first asked slowly, 'Who is there? Who is there?' and then answered quickly, 'The miller! the miller!' and at last quite in a hurry, 'He steals bravely! he steals bravely! three pecks in a bushel.'
