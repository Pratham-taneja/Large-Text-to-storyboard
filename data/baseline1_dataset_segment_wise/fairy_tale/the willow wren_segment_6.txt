	From that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by daylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her feathers out. She only flies out by night, but hates and pursues mice because they make such ugly holes. The little bird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen, because he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught. He steals about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he sometimes cries, 'I am King,' and for this reason, the other birds call him in mockery, 'King of the hedges' (ZaunkÃ¶nig). No one, however, was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little King. As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air and cries, 'Ah, how beautiful that is! beautiful that is! beautiful, beautiful! ah, how beautiful that is!'
