	'A good trade,' replied the old man; 'but what hast thou brought back with thee from thy apprenticeship?' 'Father, the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table.' The tailor inspected it on all sides and said, 'Thou didst not make a masterpiece when thou mad'st that; it is a bad old table.' 'But it is a table which furnishes itself,' replied the son. 'When I set it out, and tell it to cover itself, the most beautiful dishes stand on it, and a wine also, which gladdens the heart. Just invite all our relations and friends, they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once, for the table will give them all they require.' When the company was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the room and said, 'Little table, cover thyself,' but the little table did not bestir itself, and remained just as bare as any other table which did not understand language. Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed, and was ashamed at having to stand there like a liar. The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk. The father brought out his patches again, and went on tailoring, but the son went to a master in the craft.
