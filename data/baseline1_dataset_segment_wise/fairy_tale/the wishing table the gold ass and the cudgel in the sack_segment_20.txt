	Then the turner brought the little table, and said, 'Now dear brother, speak to it.' And scarcely had the carpenter said, 'Table, cover thyself,' than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes. Then such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet known in his house, and the whole party of kinsmen stayed together till far in the night, and were all merry and glad. The tailor locked away needle and thread, yard-measure and goose, in a press, and lived with his three sons in joy and splendour. (What, however, has become of the goat who was to blame for the tailor driving out his three sons? That I will tell thee. She was ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox's hole and crept into it. When the fox came home, he was met by two great eyes shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away. A bear met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said, 'What is the matter with thee, brother Fox, why dost thou look like that?' 'Ah,' answered Redskin, 'a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me with its fiery eyes.' 'We will soon drive him out,' said the bear, and went with him to the cave and looked in, but when he saw the fiery eyes, fear seized on him likewise; he would have nothing to do with the furious beast, and took to his heels. The bee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said, 'Bear, thou art really pulling a very pitiful face; what has become of all thy gaiety?' 'It is all very well for thee to talk,' replied the bear, 'a furious beast with staring eyes is in Redskin's house, and we can't drive him out.' The bee said, 'Bear I pity thee, I am a poor weak creature whom thou wouldst not turn aside to look at, but still, I believe, I can help thee.' She flew into the fox's cave, lighted on the goat's smoothly-shorn head, and stung her so violently, that she sprang up, crying 'Meh, meh,' and ran forth into the world as if mad, and to this hour no one knows where she has gone.)
