The wolf had the fox with him, and whatsoever the wolf wished, that the fox was compelled to do, for he was the weaker, and he would gladly have been rid of his master. It chanced that once as they were going through the forest, the wolf said, 'Red-fox, get me something to eat, or else I will eat thee thyself.' Then the fox answered, 'I know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs; if thou art inclined, we will fetch one of them.' That suited the wolf, and they went thither, and the fox stole the little lamb, took it to the wolf, and went away. The wolf devoured it, but was not satisfied with one; he wanted the other as well, and went to get it. As, however, he did it so awkwardly, the mother of the little lamb heard him, and began to cry out terribly, and to bleat so that the farmer came running there. They found the wolf, and beat him so mercilessly, that he went to the fox limping and howling. 'Thou hast misled me finely,' said he; 'I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks surprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly.' The fox replied, 'Why art thou such a glutton?'
