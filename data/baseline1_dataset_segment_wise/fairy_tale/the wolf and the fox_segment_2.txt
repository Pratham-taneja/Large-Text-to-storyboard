	On the third day, when they were out together, and the wolf could only limp along painfully, he again said, 'Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat thee thyself.' The fox answered, 'I know a man who has been killing, and the salted meat is lying in a barrel in the cellar; we will get that.' Said the wolf, 'I will go when thou dost, that thou mayest help me if I am not able to get away.' 'I am willing,' said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar. There was meat in abundance, and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought, 'There is plenty of time before I need leave off!' The fox liked it also, but looked about everywhere, and often ran to the hole by which they had come in, and tried if his body was still thin enough to slip through it. The wolf said, 'Dear fox, tell me why thou art running here and there so much, and jumping in and out?'
