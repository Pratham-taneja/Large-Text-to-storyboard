There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said, 'Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he come in, he will devour you allâ-skin, hair, and all. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.' The kids said, 'Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.' Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.
