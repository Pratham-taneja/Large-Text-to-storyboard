	It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called, 'Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice; 'We will not open the door,' cried they, 'thou art not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but thy voice is rough; thou art the wolf!' Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. The he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and cried, 'Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried, 'We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like thee; thou art the wolf.' Then the wolf ran to a baker and said, 'I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.' And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said, 'Strew some white meal over my feet for me.' The miller thought to himself, 'The wolf wants to deceive someone,' and refused; but the wolf said, 'If thou wilt not do it, I will devour thee.' Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly men are like that.
