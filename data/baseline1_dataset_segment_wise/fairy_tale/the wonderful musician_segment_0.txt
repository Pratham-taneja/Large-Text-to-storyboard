There was once a wonderful musician, who went quite alone through a forest and thought of all manner of things, and when nothing was left for him to think about, he said to himself, 'Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither a good companion for myself.' Then he took his fiddle from his back, and played so that it echoed through the trees. It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him. 'Ah, here is a wolf coming! I have no desire for him!' said the musician; but the wolf came nearer and said to him, 'Ah, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play. I should like to learn that, too.' 'It is soon learnt,' the musician replied, 'thou hast only to do all that I bid thee.' 'Oh, musician,' said the wolf, 'I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.' The musician bade him follow, and when they had gone part of the way together, they came to an old oak-tree which was hollow inside, and cleft in the middle. 'Look,' said the musician, 'if thou wilt learn to fiddle, put thy fore paws into this crevice.' The wolf obeyed, but the musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner. 'Stay there until I come back again,' said the musician, and went his way.
