It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him. 'Ah, there's a fox coming!' said the musician. 'I have no desire for him.' The fox came up to him and said, 'Oh, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play! I should like to learn that too.' 'That is soon learnt,' said the musician. 'Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee.' 'Oh, musician,' then said the fox, 'I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.' 'Follow me,' said the musician; and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to a footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it. There the musician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush down to the ground, and put his foot on the top of it, then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, 'Now little fox, if thou wilt learn something, give me thy left front paw.' The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough. 'Little fox,' said he, 'now reach me thy right paw' and he tied it to the right bough. When he had examined whether they were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up again, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling in the air. 'Wait there till I come back again,' said the musician, and went his way.
