Once on a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb, and did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow one hair's breadth. Once when the father was going out to plough, the little one said, 'Father, I will go out with you.' 'Thou wouldst go out with me?' said the father. 'Stay here, thou wilt be of no use out there, besides thou mightest get lost!' Then Thumbling began to cry, and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him with him. When he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him in a freshly-cut furrow. Whilst he was there, a great giant came over the hill. 'Do thou see that great bogie?' said the father, for he wanted to frighten the little fellow to make him good; 'he is coming to fetch thee.' The giant, however, had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow. He took up little Thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him. His father stood by, but could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else but that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him again.
