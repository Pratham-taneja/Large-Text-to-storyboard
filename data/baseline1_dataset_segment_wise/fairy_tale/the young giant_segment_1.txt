But the giant thought, 'We must do better than that,' took him back again, and suckled him two years longer. When he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground. That was still not enough for the giant; he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, 'Now just tear up a proper stick for me,' the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him. 'Now that will do,' said the giant, 'thou art perfect,' and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him. His father was there following the plough.
