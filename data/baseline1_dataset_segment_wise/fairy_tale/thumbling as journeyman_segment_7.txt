	The little tailor, however, would not stay any longer in a house where he fared so ill, so at once set out on his journey again. But his liberty did not last long. In the open country he met with a fox who snapped him up in a fit of absence. 'Hollo, Mr. Fox,' cried the little tailor, 'it is I who am sticking in your throat, set me at liberty again.' 'Thou art right,' answered the fox. 'Thou art next to nothing for me, but if thou wilt promise me the fowls in thy father's yard I will let thee go.' 'With all my heart,' replied Thumbling. 'Thou shalt have all the cocks and hens, that I promise thee.' Then the fox let him go again, and himself carried him home. When the father once more saw his dear son, he willingly gave the fox all the fowls which he had. 'For this I likewise bring thee a handsome bit of money,' said Thumbling, and gave his father the kreuzer which he earned on his travels.
