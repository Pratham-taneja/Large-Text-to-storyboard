'Never mind!' thought he; 'one wants no candle to show one light to go to sleep by.' But now that it was pitch dark he felt a huge blow fall upon his head. 'Foul play!' cried he; 'if I get such another box on the ear I shall just give it back again': and this he really did when the next blow came.

The miller was glad to find the charm was broken, and would have given him a great deal of money. 'I want no money, I have quite enough,' said he, as he took his meal on his back, and went home to his master to claim his wages.
