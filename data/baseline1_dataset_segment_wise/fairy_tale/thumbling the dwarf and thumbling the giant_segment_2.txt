So Thumbling, instead of being a little dwarf, became like the giantâtall, and stout, and strong:âso that at the end of two years, when the old giant took him into the woods to try him, and said, 'Pull up that birch-tree for yourself to walk with,' the lad was so strong that he tore it up by the root. The giant thought he would make him a still stronger man than this: so after taking care of him two years more he took him into the wood to try his strength again. This time he took hold of one of the thickest oaks, and pulled it up as if it were mere sport to him. Then the old giant said, 'Well done, my man! you will do now.' So he carried him back to the field where he first found him.
