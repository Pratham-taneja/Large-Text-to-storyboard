	His father happened to be just then ploughing his field again, as he was when he lost his son. The young giant went up to him and said, 'Look here, father, see who I am:âdon't you know your own son?' But the husbandman was frightened, and cried out, 'No, no, you are not my son; begone about your business.' 'Indeed, I am your son; let me plough a little, I can plough as well as you.' 'No, go your ways,' said the father; but as he was afraid of the tall man, he at last let go the plough, and sat down on the ground beside it. Then the youth laid hold of the ploughshare, and though he only pushed with one hand, he drove it deep into the earth. The ploughman cried out, 'If you must plough, pray do not push so hard; you are doing more harm than good': but his son took off the horses, and said, 'Father, go home, and tell my mother to get ready a good dinner; I'll go round the field meanwhile.' So he went on driving the plough without any horses, till he had done two mornings' work by himself. Then he harrowed it; and when all was over, took up plough, harrow, horses and all, and carried them home like a bundle of straw.
