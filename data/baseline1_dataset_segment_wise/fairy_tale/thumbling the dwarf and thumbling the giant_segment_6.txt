	The next morning the new workman was about to begin to work, but at the first stroke that he hit, when his master brought him the iron red hot, he shivered it in pieces, and the anvil sunk so deep into the earth that he could not get it out again. This made the old fellow very angry: 'Holla!' cried he, 'I can't have you for a workman, you are too clumsy; we must put an end to our bargain.' 'Very well,' said the other, 'but you must pay for what I have done; so let me give you only one little stroke, and then the bargain is all over.' So saying, he gave him a thump that tossed him over a load of hay that stood near. Then he took the thickest bar of iron in the forge for a walking-stick, and went on his way.
