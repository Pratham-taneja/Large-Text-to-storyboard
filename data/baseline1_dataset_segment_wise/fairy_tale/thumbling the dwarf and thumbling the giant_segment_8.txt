	Just before the wood was a hollow way, through which all must pass; so he drove the cart on first, and built up behind him such a mound of fagots and briers that no horse could pass. This done, he drove on, and as he was going into the wood met the others coming out on their road home. 'Drive away,' said he, 'I shall be home before you still.' However, he only went a very little way into the wood, and tearing up one of the largest timber trees, put it into his cart, and turned about homewards. When he came to the pile of fagots, he found all the others standing there, not being able to pass by. 'So,' said he, 'you see if you had staid with me, you would have been home just as soon, and might have slept an hour or two longer.' Then he took his tree on one shoulder, and his cart on the other, and pushed through as easily as though he were laden with feathers; and when he reached the yard he showed the tree to the farmer, and asked if it was not a famous walking-stick. 'Wife,' said the farmer, 'this man is worth something; if he sleeps longer, still he works better than the rest.'
