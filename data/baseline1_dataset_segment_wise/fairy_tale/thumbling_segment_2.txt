	One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, 'How I wish that there was any one who would bring the cart to me!' 'Oh father,' cried Thumbling, 'I will soon bring the cart, rely on that; it shall be in the forest at the appointed time.' The man smiled and said, 'How can that be done, thou art far too small to lead the horse by the reins?' 'That's of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse's ear and call out to him how he is to go.' 'Well,' answered the man, 'for once we will try it.'
