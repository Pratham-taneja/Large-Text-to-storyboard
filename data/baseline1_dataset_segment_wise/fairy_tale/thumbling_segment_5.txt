Not long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two men go by, and one of them was saying, 'How shall we contrive to get hold of the rich pastor's silver and gold?' 'I could tell thee that,' cried Thumbling, interrupting them. 'What was that?' said one of the thieves in fright, 'I heard some one speaking.' They stood still listening, and Thumbling spoke again, and said, 'Take me with you, and I'll help you.'
