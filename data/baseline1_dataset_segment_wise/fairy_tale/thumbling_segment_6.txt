	'But where art thou?' 'Just look on the ground, and observe from whence my voice comes,' he replied. There the thieves at length found him, and lifted him up. 'Thou little imp, how wilt thou help us?' they said. 'A great deal,' said he, 'I will creep into the pastor's room through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever you want to have.' 'Come then,' they said, 'and we will see what thou canst do.' When they got to the pastor's house, Thumbling crept into the room, but instantly cried out with all his might, 'Do you want to have everything that is here?' The thieves were alarmed, and said, 'But do speak softly, so as not to waken any one!' Thumbling however, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried again, 'What do you want? Do you want to have everything that is here?' The cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up in bed, and listened. The thieves, however, had in their fright run some distance away, but at last they took courage, and thought, 'The little rascal wants to mock us.' They came back and whispered to him, 'Come, be serious, and reach something out to us.' Then Thumbling again cried as loudly as he could, 'I really will give you everything, just put your hands in.' The maid who was listening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed and rushed to the door. The thieves took flight, and ran as if the Wild Huntsman were behind them, but as the maid could not see anything, she went to strike a light. When she came to the place with it, Thumbling, unperceived, betook himself to the granary, and the maid, after she had examined every corner and found nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that, after all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears.
