	When the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from the field. She told him what unlooked-for things had befallen her, and then added, 'I am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of sending something to my poor husband. Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven?' The son was full of astonishment. 'Mother,' said he, 'it is not every day that a man comes from Heaven in this way, I will go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found; he must tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.' He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed. He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was just going to count the money in the purse. 'Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven?' cried the youth to him. 'Yes,' answered the peasant, 'he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up that hill, from whence it will be rather nearer; you could still catch him up, if you were to ride fast.' 'Alas,' said the youth, 'I have been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has completely worn me out; you know the man, be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come here.' 'Aha!' thought the peasant, 'here is another who has no wick in his lamp!' 'Why should I not do you this favor?' said he, and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot. The youth remained sitting there till night fell, but the peasant never came back. 'The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,' thought he, 'and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father.' He went home and told his mother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always running about. 'Thou hast done well,' answered she, 'thy legs are younger than his, and thou canst go on foot.'
