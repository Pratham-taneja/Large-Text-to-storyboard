	When the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and said, 'Trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who are still sillier fools than you; this time you escape without a beating, I will store it up for another occasion.' Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather's chair, and said, 'It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows. If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite willing to hold it in honor.' So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simple folks.
