'I'm so tired of Christmas I wish there never would be another one!' exclaimed a discontented-looking little girl, as she sat idly watching her mother arrange a pile of gifts two days before they were to be given.

	'Why, Effie, what a dreadful thing to say! You are as bad as old Scrooge; and I'm afraid something will happen to you, as it did to him, if you don't care for dear Christmas,' answered mamma, almost dropping the silver horn she was filling with delicious candies.

	'Who was Scrooge? What happened to him?' asked Effie, with a glimmer of interest in her listless face, as she picked out the sourest lemon-drop she could find; for nothing sweet suited her just then.
