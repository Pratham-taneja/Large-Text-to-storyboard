	One day Trib saw Pib catch a squirrel, and having eaten it he brought the tail to her as a trophy of his skill. This displeased his mistress, and she gave him away, after a good scolding for killing squirrels and letting mice, his lawful prey, go free.

	Pib was so depressed that he went into the bag without a mew or a scratch, and was borne away to his new home in another part of the town.
