PART I.

	If any one had asked Johnny Morris who were his best friends, he would have answered,--

	'The sun and the wind, next to mother.'

	Johnny lived in a little court that led off from one of the busiest streets in the city,--a noisy street, where horse-car bells tinkled and omnibuses rumbled all day long, going and coming from several great depots near by. The court was a dull place, with only two or three shabby houses in it, and a high blank wall at the end.
