	DEAR GIOVANNI,--Papa has made this nice gate, so you can come

	in when you like and not be tired. We are to have two keys, and no one

	else can open it. A little bell is to ring when we pull the cord, and

	we can run and see what we want. The paint is wet. Papa did it,

	and the men put up the door last night. I helped them, and did not go

	in my bed till ten. It was very nice to do it so. I hope you will like
