OUT in the garden Mary sat hemming a pocket-handkerchief, and there came a little insect runningâoh, in such a hurry!âacross the small stone table by her side.

	The sewing was not done, for Mary liked doing nothing best, and she thought it would be fun to drop her thimble over the little ant. âNow he is in the dark,â said she. âCan he mind? He is only such a little tiny thing.â
