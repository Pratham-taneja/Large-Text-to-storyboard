	âQuite. The four ants talked together by gentle touches of their horns. They looked as if they were telling one another what a dreadful accident it was, and how nobody knew whose turn would come next. After this they set to work with a will. Two of them pushed the berry as hard as they could, while the other two pulled their friend out by the hind legs. When at last he was free, they crowded round as if petting and kissing him. You see these little ant folk have found out that ââTis love, love, love, that makes the world go round.â I shouldnât wonder if that ant you teased so thoughtlessly is gone off to tell the news at home that there is a drop of honey to be had here.â
