The handkerchief was soaked as if somebody had been crying very much, when she went out to fetch it as soon as the sun shone. She remembered who was under the thimble. âI wonder what he is doing,â said Mary. But when she lifted up the thimble the little tiny thing lay stiff and still.

	âOh, did he die of being under the thimble?â she said aloud. âI am afraid he did mind.â

	âWhy did you do that, Mary?â said her father, who was close by, and who had guessed the truth. âSee! he moves one of his legs. Run to the house and fetch a wee taste of honey from the breakfast-table for the little thing you starved.â
