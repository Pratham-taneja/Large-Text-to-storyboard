	' Well, uncle, is there any noos ? '

	' Noos ' ! What ' noos ' should there be ? For sixty-nine years he had never lived further than five miles from Halvesham. For nearly sixty of those years he had bent his back above the soil. There were indeed historic occasions: once, for instance, when he had married Annie Hachet. And there was the birth of his daughter. There was also a famous occasion when he had visited London. Once he had been to a flower-show at Market Roughborough. He either went or didn't go to church on Sundays. He had had many interesting chats with Mr. James at ' The Cowman,' and three years ago had sold a pig to Mrs. Waig. But he couldn't always have interesting ' noos ' of this sort up his sleeve. Didn't the silly gaffer know that for the last three weeks he had been thinning out turnips for Mr. Dodge on this very same field ? What ' noos ' could there be?
