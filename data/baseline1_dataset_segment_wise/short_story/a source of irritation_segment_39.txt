He was pulled down a kind of shaft and found himself in a room buried right underground, where three officers were drinking and smoking. The soldiers saluted and handed a type- written dispatch. The officers looked at him drunkenly, and one came up and pulled his beard and spat in his face, and called him ' an old English swine.' He then shouted out some instructions to the soldiers, and they led him out into the narrow trench. One walked be- hind him and occasionally prodded him with the butt- end of a gim. The trenches were half-full of water, and reeked of gases, powder, and decaying matter.
