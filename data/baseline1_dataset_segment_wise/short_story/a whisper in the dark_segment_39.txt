	âMore than I can tell you!â

	âAnd my father, Sybil?â

	âBoth yes and no to that question, Guy; I hardly know him yet.â

	âBless you! Iâm that already, for I fear no one. Why, I sat on his knee yesterday and smoked a cigarette of his own offering, though madame would have fainted if she had seen me; then I slept on his arm an hour, and he was fatherly kind, though I teased him like a gnat.â
