	âDear Guy, forgive me if I pained you. Iâm a thoughtless creature, but Iâm not malicious, and a word will restrain me if kindly spoken. My home is always yours, and when my fortune is mine you shall never want, if you are not too proud to accept help from your own kin. You are a little proud, arenât you?â
