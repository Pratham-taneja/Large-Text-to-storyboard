	The morningâs chat flashed into my mind, and I asked myself, âIs Guy jealous so soon?â It looked a little like it, for he threw himself upon a couch and lay there silent and morose; while my uncle paced to and fro, thinking deeply, while apparently listening to the song he bade me finish. I did so, then followed the whim that now possessed me, for I wanted to try my power over them both, to see if I could restore that gentler mood of my uncleâs, and assure myself that Guy cared whether I was friendliest with him or not.
