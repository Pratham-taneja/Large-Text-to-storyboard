	âI am civil when you leave me alone; I do agree to marry her, but I wonât be hurried or go a-wooing except in my own way. You know I never liked the bargain, for itâs nothing else; yet I can reconcile myself to being sold, if it relieves you and gives us both a home. But, father, mind this, if you tie me to that girlâs sash too tightly I shall break away entirely, and then where are we?â
