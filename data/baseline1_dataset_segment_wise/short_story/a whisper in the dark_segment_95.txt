	âWhy should I? It is not binding, you know, and Iâm too young to lose my liberty just yet; besides, such compacts are unjust, unwise. What right had my father to mate me in my cradle? how did he know what I should become, or Guy? how could he tell that I should not love some one else better? No! Iâll not be bargained away like a piece of merchandise, but love and marry when I please!â
