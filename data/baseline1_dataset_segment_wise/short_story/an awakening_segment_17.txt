From a window at the upper part of the house she saw Ed Handby cross the street and sit down on a horse block before the house of a neighbor.

She was made happy by the sight and when George Willard came to the door she greeted him effusively and hurriedly put on her hat. She thought that as she walked through the streets with young Willard, Ed Handby would follow and she wanted to make him suffer.
