ONCE on a time there were five goodies, who were all reaping in a field; they were all childless, and all wished to have a bairn. All at once they set eyes on a strangely big goose-egg, almost as big as a man's head.

	'I saw it first,' said one.

	'I saw it just as soon as you,' screamed another.

	'Heaven help me, but I will have it,' swore the third; 'I was the first to see it.'
