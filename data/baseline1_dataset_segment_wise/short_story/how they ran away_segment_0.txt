Two little boys sat on the fence whittling arrows one fine day. Said one little boy to the other little boy,--

	'Let's do something jolly.'

	'All right. What will we do?'

	'Run off to the woods and be hunters.'

	'What can we hunt?'

	'Bears and foxes.'

	'Mullin says there ain't any round here.'

	'Well, we can shoot squirrels and snare wood-chucks.'
