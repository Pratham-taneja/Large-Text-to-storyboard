	At that time there lived in Rome a celebrated sculptor by the name of Aurelius. Out of clay, marble and bronze he created forms of gods and men of such beauty that this beauty was proclaimed immortal. But he himself was not satisfied, and said there was a supreme beauty that he had never succeeded in expressing in marble or bronze. 'I have not yet gathered the radiance of the moon,' he said; 'I have not yet caught the glare of the sun. There is no soul in my marble, there is no life in my beautiful bronze.' And when by moonlight he would slowly wander along the roads, crossing the black shadows of the cypress-trees, his white tunic flashing in the moonlight, those he met used to laugh good-naturedly and say: 'Is it moonlight that you are gathering, Aurelius? Why did you not bring some baskets along?'
