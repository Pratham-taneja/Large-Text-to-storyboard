	Prometheus. The truth unknown to man is the madness of him who proclaims it. Proceed, and have done.

	Ahasverus. Glory pays nothing, and dies.

	Prometheus. This glory will never die. Have done; have done; show the sharp beak of the eagle where it is to devour my entrails. But hear me ... No, hear nothing; you cannot understand me.

	Ahasverus. Speak; speak.

	Prometheus. The ephemeral world cannot understand the world eternal; but you will be the link between the two.
