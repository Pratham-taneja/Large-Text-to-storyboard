	Prometheus. I speak nothing; fetter these wrists well, that I shall not flee,âso that I shall be here on your return. Tell you all?

A noble family, all-seeing and powerful, will be the perfect synthesis of the divine and the human. The times will be others, but between them and these a link is necessary, and you shall be that link.
