	Ahasverus. It is not too much in recompense for the deep ignominy in which I have dwelt. Where one life heaped mire, another life will place a halo. Speak, speak on ... speak on ... (He continues to dream. The two eagles draw near.)

	First Eagle. Ay, ay, ay! Alas for this last man; he is dying, yet he dreams of life.

	Second Eagle. Not so much that he hated it as that he loved it so much.
