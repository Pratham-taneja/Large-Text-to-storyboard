	âCosy nest this,â said Mr. Jaffrey, glancing complacently over the apartment. âWhat is more cheerful, now, in the fall of the year, than an open wood-fire? Do you hear those little chirps and twitters coming out of that piece of apple-wood? Those are the ghosts of the robins and bluebirds that sang upon the bough when it was in blossom last spring. In summer whole flocks of them come fluttering about the fruit trees under the window; so I have singing birds all the year round. I take it very easy here, I can tell you, summer and winter. Not much society. Tobias is not, perhaps, what one would term a great intellectual force, but he means well. Heâs a realist, believes in coming down to what he calls âthe hard pan;â but his heart is in the right place, and heâs very kind to me. The wisest thing I ever did in my life was to sell out my grain business over at Kââ, thirteen years ago, and settle down at the Corners. When a man has made a competency, what does he want more? Besides, at that time an event occurred which destroyed any ambition I may have had,âMehetabel died.â
