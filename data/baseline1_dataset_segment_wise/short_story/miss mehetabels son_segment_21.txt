	âNo doubt,â I said to myself that night, as I lay in bed, thinking over the matter, âthis once possible but now impossible child is a great comfort to the old gentleman,âa greater comfort, perhaps, than a real son would be. Maybe Andy will vanish with the shades and mists of night, heâs such an unsubstantial infant; but if he doesnât, and Mr. Jaffrey finds pleasure in talking to me about his son, I shall humour the old fellow. It wouldnât be a Christian act to knock over his harmless fancy.â
