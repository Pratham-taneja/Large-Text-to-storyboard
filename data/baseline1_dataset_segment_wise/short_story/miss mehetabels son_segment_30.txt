	At first I had lent myself to the old dreamerâs whim with a keen perception of the humour of the thing; but by-and-by I found I was talking and thinking of Miss Mehetabelâs son as though he were a veritable personage. Mr. Jaffrey spoke of the child with such an air of conviction!âas if Andy were playing among his toys in the next room, or making mud-pies down in the yard. In these conversations, it should be observed, the child was never supposed to be present, except on that single occasion when Mr. Jaffrey leaned over the cradle. After one of our sÃ©ances I would lie awake until the small hours, thinking of the boy, and then fall asleep only to have indigestible dreams about him. Through the day, and sometimes in the midst of complicated calculations, I would catch myself wondering what Andy was up to now! There was no shaking him off; he became an inseparable nightmare to me; and I felt that if I remained much longer at Bayleyâs Four Corners I should turn into just such another bald-headed, mild-eyed visionary as Silas Jaffrey.
