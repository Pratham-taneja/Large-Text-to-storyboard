	There had lately sprung up on the corner of Mr. Jaffreyâs bureau a small tin house, Gothic in architecture, and pink in colour, with a slit in the roof, and the word âBankâ painted on one faÃ§ade. Several times in the course of an evening Mr. Jaffrey would rise from his chair, without interrupting the conversation, and gravely drop a nickel through the scuttle of the bank. It was pleasant to observe the solemnity of his countenance as he approached the edifice, and the air of triumph with which he resumed his seat by the fireplace. One night I missed the tin bank. It had disappeared, deposits and all. Evidently there had been a defalcation on rather a large scale. I strongly suspected that Mr. Sewell was at the bottom of it; but my suspicion was not shared by Mr. Jaffrey, who, remarking my glance at the bureau, became suddenly depressed. âIâm afraid,â he said, âthat I have failed to instil into Andrew those principles of integrityâwhichâwhichâââ And the old gentleman quite broke down.
