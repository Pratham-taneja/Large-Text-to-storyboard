He was as sensitive as a barometer. The approach of a storm sent his mercury down instantly. When the weather was fair he was hopeful and sunny, and Andyâs prospects were brilliant. When the weather was overcast and threatening he grew restless and despondent, and was afraid the boy wasnât going to turn out well.
