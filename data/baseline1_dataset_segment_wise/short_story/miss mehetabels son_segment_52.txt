	Perhaps nothing that happened during my stay at Bayleyâs Four Corners took me so completely by surprise as Mr. Jaffreyâs radiant countenance the next morning. The morning itself was not fresher or sunnier. His round face literally shone with geniality and happiness. His eyes twinkled like diamonds, and the magnetic light of his hair was turned on full. He came into my room while I was packing my valise. He chirped and prattled and carolled, and was sorry I was going away,âbut never a word about Andy. However, the boy had probably been dead several years then!
