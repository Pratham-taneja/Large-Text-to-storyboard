	'Quee, quee!   Wait and see:   You were good to me;   So here I come,   From my little home,   To help you willingly,'   said a friendly voice; and there was the mouse, looking at her with its bright eyes full of gratitude. 'Why, you dear little thing, I'm very glad to see you; but I'm sure you can't help me across this desert,' said Rosy, stroking its soft back. 'That's easy enough,' answered the mouse, rubbing its paws briskly. 'I'll just call my friend the lion; he lives here, and he'll take you across with pleasure.' 'Oh, I'm afraid he'd rather eat me. How dare you call that fierce beast?' cried Rosy, much surprised. 'I gnawed him out of a net once, and he promised to help me. He is a noble animal, and he will keep his word.' Then the mouse sang, in its shrill little voice,--   'O lion, grand,     Come over the sand,   And help me now, I pray!     Here's a little lass,     Who wants to pass;   Please carry her on her way.'   In a moment a loud roar was heard, and a splendid yellow lion, with fiery eyes and a long mane, came bounding over the sand to meet them. 'What can I do for you, tiny friend?' he said, looking at the mouse, who was not a bit frightened, though Rosy hid behind a rock, expecting every moment to be eaten. Mousie told him, and the good lion said pleasantly,-- 'I'll take the child along. Come on, my dear; sit on my back and hold fast to my mane, for I'm a swift horse, and you might fall off.' Then he crouched down like a great cat, and Rosy climbed up, for he was so kind she could not fear him; and away they went, racing over the sand till her hair whistled in the wind. As soon as she got her breath, she thought it great fun to go flying along, while other lions and tigers rolled their fierce eyes at her, but dared not touch her; for this lion was king of all, and she was quite safe. They met a train of camels with loads on their backs; and the people travelling with them wondered what queer thing was riding that fine lion. It looked like a very large monkey in a red cloak, but went so fast they never saw that it was a little girl. 'How glad I am that I was kind to the mouse; for if the good little creature had not helped me, I never could have crossed this desert,' said Rosy, as the lion walked awhile to rest himself. 'And if the mouse had not gnawed me out of the net I never should have come at her call. You see, little people can conquer big ones, and make them gentle and friendly by kindness,' answered the lion. Then away they went again, faster than ever, till they came to the green country. Rosy thanked the good beast, and he ran back, for if any one saw him, they would try to catch him. 'Now I have only to climb up these mountains and find father,' thought Rosy, as she saw the great hills before her, with many steep roads winding up to the top, and far, far away rose the smoke from the huts where the men lived and dug for gold. She started off bravely, but took the wrong road, and after climbing a long while found the path ended in rocks over which she could not go. She was very tired and hungry; for her food was gone, and there were no houses in this wild place. Night was coming on, and it was so cold she was afraid she would freeze before morning, but dared not go on lest she should fall down some steep hole and be killed. Much discouraged, she lay down on the moss and cried a little; then she tried to sleep, but something kept buzzing in her ear, and looking carefully she saw a fly prancing about on the moss, as if anxious to make her listen to his song,--   'Rosy, my dear,     Don't cry,--I'm here   To help you all I can.     I'm only a fly,     But you'll see that I   Will keep my word like a man.'   Rosy couldn't help laughing to hear the brisk little fellow talk as if he could do great things; but she was very glad to see him and hear his cheerful song, so she held out her finger, and while he sat there told him all her troubles. 'Bless your heart! my friend the eagle will carry you right up the mountains and leave you at your father's door,' cried the fly; and he was off with a flirt of his gauzy wings, for he meant what he said. Rosy was ready for her new horse, and not at all afraid after the whale and the lion; so when a great eagle swooped down and alighted near her, she just looked at his sharp claws, big eyes, and crooked beak as coolly as if he had been a cock-robin. He liked her courage, and said kindly in his rough voice,-- 'Hop up, little girl, and sit among my feathers. Hold me fast round the neck, or you may grow dizzy and get a fall.' Rosy nestled down among the thick gray feathers, and put both arms round his neck; and whiz they went, up, up, up, higher and higher, till the trees looked like grass, they were so far below. At first it was very cold, and Rosy cuddled deeper into her feather bed; then, as they came nearer to the sun, it grew warm, and she peeped out to see the huts standing in a green spot on the top of the mountain. 'Here we are. You'll find all the men are down in the mine at this time. They won't come up till morning; so you will have to wait for your father. Good-by; good luck, my dear.' And the eagle soared away, higher still, to his nest among the clouds. It was night now, but fires were burning in all the houses; so Rosy went from hut to hut trying to find her father's, that she might rest while she waited: at last in one the picture of a pretty little girl hung on the wall, and under it was written, 'My Rosy.' Then she knew that this was the right place; and she ate some supper, put on more wood, and went to bed, for she wanted to be fresh when her father came in the morning. While she slept a storm came on,--thunder rolled and lightning flashed, the wind blew a gale, and rain poured,--but Rosy never waked till dawn, when she heard men shouting outside,-- 'Run, run! The river is rising! We shall all be drowned!' Rosy ran out to see what was the matter, though the wind nearly blew her away; she found that so much rain had made the river overflow till it began to wash the banks away. 'What shall I do? what shall I do?' cried Rosy, watching the men rush about like ants, getting their bags of gold ready to carry off before the water swept them away, if it became a flood. As if in answer to her cry, Rosy heard a voice say close by,--   'Splash, dash!     Rumble and crash!   Here come the beavers gay;     See what they do,     Rosy, for you,   Because you helped me one day.'   And there in the water was the little fish swimming about, while an army of beavers began to pile up earth and stones in a high bank to keep the river back. How they worked, digging and heaping with teeth and claws, and beating the earth hard with their queer tails like shovels! Rosy and the men watched them work, glad to be safe, while the storm cleared up; and by the time the dam was made, all danger was over. Rosy looked into the faces of the rough men, hoping her father was there, and was just going to ask about him, when a great shouting rose again, and all began to run to the pit hole, saying,-- 'The sand has fallen in! The poor fellows will be smothered! How can we get them out? how can we get them out?' Rosy ran too, feeling as if her heart would break; for her father was down in the mine, and would die soon if air did not come to him. The men dug as hard as they could; but it was a long job, and they feared they would not be in time. Suddenly hundreds of moles came scampering along, and began to burrow down through the earth, making many holes for air to go in; for they know how to build galleries through the ground better than men can. Every one was so surprised they stopped to look on; for the dirt flew like rain as the busy little fellows scratched and bored as if making an underground railway. 'What does it mean?' said the men. 'They work faster than we can, and better; but who sent them? Is this strange little girl a fairy?' Before Rosy could speak, all heard a shrill, small voice singing,--   'They come at my call;     And though they are small,   They'll dig the passage clear:     I never forget;     We'll save them yet,   For love of Rosy dear.'   Then all saw a little gray mouse sitting on a stone, waving her tail about, and pointing with her tiny paw to show the moles where to dig. The men laughed; and Rosy was telling them who she was, when a cry came from the pit, and they saw that the way was clear so they could pull the buried men up. In a minute they got ropes, and soon had ten poor fellows safe on the ground; pale and dirty, but all alive, and all shouting as if they were crazy,-- 'Tom's got it! Tom's got it! Hooray for Tom!' 'What is it?' cried the others; and then they saw Tom come up with the biggest lump of gold ever found in the mountains. Every one was glad of Tom's luck; for he was a good man, and had worked a long time, and been sick, and couldn't go back to his wife and child. When he saw Rosy, he dropped the lump, and caught her up, saying,-- 'My little girl! she's better than a million pounds of gold.' Then Rosy was very happy, and went back to the hut, and had a lovely time telling her father all about her troubles and her travels. He cried when he heard that the poor mother was dead before she could have any of the good things the gold would buy them. 'We will go away and be happy together in the pleasantest home I can find, and never part any more, my darling,' said the father, kissing Rosy as she sat on his knee with her arms round his neck. She was just going to say something very sweet to comfort him, when a fly lit on her arm and buzzed very loud,--    'Don't drive me away,     But hear what I say:   Bad men want the gold;     They will steal it to-night,     And you must take flight;   So be quiet and busy and bold.'  'I was afraid some one would take my lump away. I'll pack up at once, and we will creep off while the men are busy at work; though I'm afraid we can't go fast enough to be safe, if they miss us and come after,' said Tom, bundling his gold into a bag and looking very sober; for some of the miners were wild fellows, and might kill him for the sake of that great lump. But the fly sang again,--   'Slip away with me,     And you will see   What a wise little thing am I;     For the road I show     No man can know,   Since it's up in the pathless sky.'   Then they followed Buzz to a quiet nook in the wood; and there were the eagle and his mate waiting to fly away with them so fast and so far that no one could follow. Rosy and the bag of gold were put on the mother eagle; Tom sat astride the king bird; and away they flew to a great city, where the little girl and her father lived happily together all their lives.
