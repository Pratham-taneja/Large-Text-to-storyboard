They looked like men, but were better proportioned: they called themselves elves, and had delicate clothes on, of flower leaves trimmed with the wings of flies and gnats, which had a very good appearance. Directly they appeared, they seemed to be seeking for somethingâI knew not what; but at last some of them came towards me, and the chief pointed to my sausage-peg, and said, 'That is just such a one as we wantâit is pointedâit is capital!' and the longer he looked at my pilgrim's staff the more delighted he became.
