My daughter Grace writes me--she should have done it before--that the boys are not behaving as well as they should--she didn't tell me, as I was having such a good time she just hated to worry me--Heaven knows I've had enough worry--but now I must go--I just couldn't stay--boys are an awful responsibility--girls ain't a circumstance to them, although mine are a handful sometimes.'
