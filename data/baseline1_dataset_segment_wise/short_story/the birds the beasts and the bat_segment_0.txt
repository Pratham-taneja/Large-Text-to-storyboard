The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw. It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of Geese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. The Beasts, too, had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on the Hare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice.

	It was a terrible battle. Many a Hare and many a Mouse died. Chickens and Geese fell by the scoreâand the victor always stopped for a feast.
