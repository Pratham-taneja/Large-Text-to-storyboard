There is a story -- I cannot tell it -- I have no words. The story is almost forgotten but sometimes I remember.

	The story concerns three men in a house in a street. If I could say the words I would sing the story. I would whisper it into the ears of women, of mothers. I would run through the streets saying it over and over. My tongue would be torn loose -- it would rattle against my teeth.
