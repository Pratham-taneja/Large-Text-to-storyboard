	A third man there is who has wicked eyes and who moves nervously about the room rubbing his hands together. The three men are waiting -- waiting.

	Upstairs in the house there is a woman standing with her back to a wall, in half darkness by a window.

	That is the foundation of my story and everything I will ever know is distilled in it.

	I remember that a fourth man came to the house, a white silent man. Everything was as silent as the sea at night. His feet on the stone floor of the room where the three men were made no sound.
