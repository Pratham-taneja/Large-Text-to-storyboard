A rich old farmer, who felt that he had not many more days to live, called his sons to his bedside.

	'My sons,' he said, 'heed what I have to say to you. Do not on any account part with the estate that has belonged to our family for so many generations. Somewhere on it is hidden a rich treasure. I do not know the exact spot, but it is there, and you will surely find it. Spare no energy and leave no spot unturned in your search.'
