A Fir-tree was boasting to a Bramble, and said, somewhat contemptuously, 'You poor creature, you are of no use whatever. Now, look at me: I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men build houses; they can't do without me then.' But the Bramble replied, 'Ah, that's all very well: but you wait till they come with axes and saws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a Bramble and not a Fir.'
