	'Rejoice in our presence!' said the Air and the Sunlight; 'rejoice in thy own fresh youth!'

	But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green both winter and summer. People that saw him said, 'What a fine tree!' and toward Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe struck deep into the very pith; the tree fell to the earth with a sigh: he felt a pangâit was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness, for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place where he had sprung up. He knew well that he should never see his dear old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, any more; perhaps not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.
