	And the man told about Klumpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who notwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess. And the children clapped their hands, and cried out, 'Oh, go on! Do go on!' They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy, too, but the little man only told them about Klumpy-Dumpy. The Fir-tree stood quite still and absorbed in thought; the birds in the woods had never related the like of this. 'Klumpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes! Yes! that's the way of the world!' thought the Fir-tree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good-looking. 'Well, well! who knows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!' And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked out again with lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.
