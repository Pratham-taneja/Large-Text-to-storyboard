	In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.

	'Now, then, the splendour will begin again,' thought the Fir. But they dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft; and here in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. 'What's the meaning of this?' thought the Tree. 'What am I to do here? What shall I hear now, I wonder?' And he leaned against the wall, lost in reverie. Time enough had he, too, for his reflections; for days and nights passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way. There stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely forgotten.
