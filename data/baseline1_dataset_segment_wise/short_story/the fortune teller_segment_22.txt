He did not read the letter again, but the words hovered persistently before his eyes; or else,âwhich was even worseâthey seemed to be murmured into his ears by the voice of Villela himself. 'Come immediately to our house; I must talk to you without delay.' Spoken thus by the voice of the other they seemed pregnant with mystery and menace. Come immediately,âwhy?

So clearly did he imagine what was about to take place that he began to believe it a reality, to see it before his very eyes. Yes, without a doubt, he was afraid. He even considered arming himself, thinking that if nothing should happen he would lose nothing by this useful precaution. But at once he rejected the idea, angry with himself, and hastened his step towards Carioca square, there to take a tilbury. He arrived, entered and ordered the driver to be off at full speed.
