	In the neighborhood of the moorlands, and not far from the great arm of the North Sea and the Cattegat which is called the Lumfjorden, lay the castle of the Viking, with its water-tight stone cellars, its tower, and its three projecting storeys. On the ridge of the roof the stork had built his nest, and there the stork-mamma sat on her eggs and felt sure her hatching would come to something.

	One evening, stork-papa stayed out rather late, and when he came home he seemed quite busy, bustling, and important. 'I have something very dreadful to tell you,' said he to the stork-mamma.

	'Keep it to yourself then,' she replied. 'Remember that I am hatching eggs; it may agitate me, and will affect them.'
