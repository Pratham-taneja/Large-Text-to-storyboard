	In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits. It is called the 'Venus Mountain,' and the story goes that the 'Lady Venus,' one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there. She is also called 'Lady Halle,' as every child round Eisenach well knows. She it was who enticed the noble knight, Tannhauser, the minstrel, from the circle of singers at Wartburg into her mountain.
