	Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day Molly said, 'Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle, open the door: Tannhauser is here!'' But Anthony did not dare. Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle,' loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had really said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls; they would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away. Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him. 'I may kiss him,' she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it. Molly was very charming, but rather bold; and how she did tease!
