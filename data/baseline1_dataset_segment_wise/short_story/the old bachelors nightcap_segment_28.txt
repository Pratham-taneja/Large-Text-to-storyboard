That man was the mayor himself, who had already made a comfortable home for his wife and eleven children, by his industry. The moment he put the cap on he dreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days. 'Hallo! how the nightcap burns!' he exclaimed, as he tore it from his bead. Then a pearl rolled out, and then another, and another, and they glittered and sounded as they fell. 'What can this be? Is it paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?' They were the tears which old Anthony had shed half a century before.
