A Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself. Going up to him, he said, 'What a lucky beast you are! Your sleek coat shows how well you live: how I envy you!' Not long after the Wild Ass saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick. 'Ah, my friend,' said the Wild Ass, 'I don't envy you any more: for I see you pay dear for your comforts.'
