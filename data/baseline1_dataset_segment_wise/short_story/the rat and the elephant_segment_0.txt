A Rat was traveling along the King's highway. He was a very proud Rat, considering his small size and the bad reputation all Rats have. As Mr. Rat walked alongâhe kept mostly to the ditchâhe noticed a great commotion up the road, and soon a grand procession came in view. It was the King and his retinue.
