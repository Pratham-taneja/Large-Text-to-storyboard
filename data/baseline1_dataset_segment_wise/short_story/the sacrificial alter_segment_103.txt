	'Very well. I trust you to do so.' Louis accompanied his guest with extreme courtesy to the door. On the threshold M. Cesar paused and looked back into the dark house with a shudder. 'Ciel, but it is a tomb! I cannot take you with me this evening, but you can go to the club and sleep there.'

	'Many thanks, Monsieur, but this house is not a tomb to me. It is my home.'

	'True. A thousand pardons. Au revoir, mon fils.'
