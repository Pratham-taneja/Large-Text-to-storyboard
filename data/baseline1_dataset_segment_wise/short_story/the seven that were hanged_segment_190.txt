	Sometimes, in painful moments, he whispered, without praying, without even accounting to himself for what he was doing: 'Joy of all the afflicted!' And then he suddenly felt relieved; he had a desire to approach someone who was dear to him and complain gently:

	'Our life! . . . but is it really a life? Say, my dear, it is really a life?'

	And then suddenly he felt himself ridiculous; he would have liked to bare his breast and ask someone to beat it.
