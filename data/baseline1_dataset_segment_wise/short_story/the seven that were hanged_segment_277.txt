	'I have lost one of my rubbers,' said Sergey.

	'Well?' asked Werner, not understanding.

	'I have lost it. I am cold.'

	'Where is Vasily?'

	'I don't know. There he is.'

	Vasily was standing close by them, gloomy and motionless.

	'Where is Musya?'

	'Here I am. Is that you, Werner?'

	They looked at each other, their eyes avoiding the silent and terrible significant swaying of the lanterns. At the left the thin forest seemed to be growing lighter. And beyond, something vast and gray and flat appeared, whence came a moist breeze.
