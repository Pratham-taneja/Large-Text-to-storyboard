	Always with the same slowness and the same indolence Yanson dressed himself in all that he possessed, and tied his dirty shawl around his neck. While watching him dress, the man with the epaulets, who was smoking a cigarette, said to one of the assistants:

	'How warm it is to-day! It is spring!'

	Yanson's eyes closed; he was in a complete drowse. The guard shouted:

	'Come, come! Make haste! You are going to sleep!'

	Suddenly Yanson ceased to move.

	'I must not be hanged,' said he, with indolence.
