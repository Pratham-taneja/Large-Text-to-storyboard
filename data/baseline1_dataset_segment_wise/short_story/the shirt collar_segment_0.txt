THERE was once a fine gentleman who possessed among other things a boot-jack and a hair-brush; but he had also the finest shirt-collar in the world, and of this collar we are about to hear a story. The collar had become so old that he began to think about getting married; and one day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as a garter. âUpon my word,â said the shirt-collar, âI have never seen anything so slim and delicate, so neat and soft before. May I venture to ask your name?â
