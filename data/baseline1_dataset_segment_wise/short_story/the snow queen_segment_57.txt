	FOURTH STORY. The Prince and Princess

	Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her, a large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking at Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, 'Caw! Caw!' Good day! Good day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word 'alone' Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed by it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay.
