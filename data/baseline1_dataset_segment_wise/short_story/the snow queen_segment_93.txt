	'You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals,' said the little robber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into a corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and perches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet they moved a little when the robber maiden came. 'They are all mine,' said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs and shaking it so that its wings fluttered. 'Kiss it,' cried the little girl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. 'Up there is the rabble of the wood,' continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened before a hole high up in the wall; 'that's the rabble; they would all fly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my dear old Bac'; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a bright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. 'We are obliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every evening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at it!' and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the wall, and let it glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked; the girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.
