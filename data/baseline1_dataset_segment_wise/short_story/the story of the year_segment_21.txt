	âMay there be joy in the rooms, and under the green boughs,â said the old ruler of the year. In a few weeks he had become a very old man, with hair as white as snow. âMy resting-time draws near; the young pair of the year will soon claim my crown and sceptre.â

	âBut the night is still thine,â said the angel of Christmas, âfor power, but not for rest. Let the snow lie warmly upon the tender seed. Learn to endure the thought that another is worshipped whilst thou art still lord. Learn to endure being forgotten while yet thou livest. The hour of thy freedom will come when Spring appears.â
