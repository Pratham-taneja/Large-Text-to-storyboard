	âIt is Winter, the old man of the former year; he is not dead, as the calendar says, but he is guardian to the spring, which is coming.â

	âWhen will Spring come?â asked the sparrows, âfor we shall have better times then, and a better rule. The old times are worth nothing.â

	And in quiet thought old Winter looked at the leafless forest, where the graceful form and bends of each tree and branch could be seen; and while Winter slept, icy mists came from the clouds, and the ruler dreamt of his youthful days and of his manhood, and in the morning dawn the whole forest glittered with hoar frost, which the sun shook from the branches,âand this was the summer dream of Winter.
