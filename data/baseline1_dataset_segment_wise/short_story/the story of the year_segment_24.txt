	âWhen will Spring come?â asked the sparrows. âSpring!â Again the echo sounded from the hills on which the snow lay. The sunshine became warmer, the snow melted, and the birds twittered, âSpring is coming!â And high in the air flew the first stork, and the second followed; a lovely child sat on the back of each, and they sank down on the open field, kissed the earth, and kissed the quiet old man; and, as the mist from the mountain top, he vanished away and disappeared. And the story of the year was finished.
