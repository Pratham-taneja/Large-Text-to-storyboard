	On mighty wings the spirit of history floats through the ages, and showsâgiving courage and comfort, and awakening gentle thoughtsâon the dark nightly background, but in gleaming pictures, the thorny path of honor, which does not, like a fairy tale, end in brilliancy and joy here on earth, but stretches out beyond all time, even into eternity!
