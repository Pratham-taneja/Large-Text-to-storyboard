	Thou juicy, green, poisonous hemlock, throw thy shadow over Athensânot thou, olive tree of fame!

	Seven cities contended for the honor of giving birth to Homerâthat is to say, they contended after his death! Let us look at him as he was in his lifetime. He wanders on foot through the cities, and recites his verses for a livelihood; the thought for the morrow turns his hair gray! He, the great seer, is blind, and painfully pursues his wayâthe sharp thorn tears the mantle of the king of poets. His song yet lives, and through that alone live all the heroes and gods of antiquity.
