	Early the next morning the king and queen accompanied the lady and all the officers of the household, to see where the princess had been.

	Here it is, said the king, when they came to the first door with a cross on it.

	No, my dear husband, it must be that one, said the queen, pointing to a second door having a cross also.

	And here is one, and there is another! they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.
