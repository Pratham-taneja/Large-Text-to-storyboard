They walked along the road where once they used to ride in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants, on their way to a plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks yearly. This was their new country seat with its empty walls and its empty vessels. The crows and the magpies wheeled screaming over their heads with their mocking 'Caw, caw! Out of the nest, Caw, caw!' just as they screamed in Borreby Forest when the trees were felled.
