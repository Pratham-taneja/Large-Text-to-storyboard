A rose, a lily and a pale hyacinth. The mother herself was a gorgeous tulip; she took no notice whatever of the crowd, who all stopped in their game to drop their curtsies and make their bows; one might have thought that, like a tulip, she was rather frail in the stalk and feared to bend her back. The rose, the lily, and the pale hyacinthâyes, I saw them all three. Whose May-lambs were they one day to become, thought I; their mates would be proud knightsâperhaps even princes!
