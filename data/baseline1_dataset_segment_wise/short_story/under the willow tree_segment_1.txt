	âOnce upon a time,â said he, âthere lay on my counter two gingerbread cakes, one in the shape of a man wearing a hat, the other of a maiden without a bonnet. Their faces were on the side that was uppermost, for on the other side they looked very different. Most people have a best side to their characters, which they take care to show to the world. On the left, just where the heart is, the gingerbread man had an almond stuck in to represent it, but the maiden was honey cake all over. They were placed on the counter as samples, and after lying there a long time they at last fell in love with each other; but neither of them spoke of it to the other, as they should have done if they expected anything to follow. âHe is a man, he ought to speak the first word,â thought the gingerbread maiden; but she felt quite happyâshe was sure that her love was returned. But his thoughts were far more ambitious, as the thoughts of a man often are. He dreamed that he was a real street boy, that he possessed four real pennies, and that he had bought the gingerbread lady, and ate her up. And so they lay on the counter for days and weeks, till they grew hard and dry; but the thoughts of the maiden became ever more tender and womanly. âAh well, it is enough for me that I have been able to live on the same counter with him,â said she one day; when suddenly, âcrack,â and she broke in two. âAh,â said the gingerbread man to himself, âif she had only known of my love, she would have kept together a little longer.â And here they both are, and that is their history,â said the cake man. âYou think the history of their lives and their silent love, which never came to anything, very remarkable; and there they are for you.â So saying, he gave Joanna the gingerbread man, who was still quite wholeâand to Knud the broken maiden; but the children had been so much impressed by the story, that they had not the heart to eat the lovers up.
