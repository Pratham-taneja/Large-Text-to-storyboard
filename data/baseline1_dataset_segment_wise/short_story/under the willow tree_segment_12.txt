But every evening after working hoursâand they worked by candle-light thenâhe walked out into the town, and through the street in which Joanna lived, to look up at her window. It was almost always lighted up; and one evening he saw the shadow of her face quite plainly on the window blind; that was a glorious evening for him. His masterâs wife did not like his always going out in the evening, idling, wasting time, as she called it, and she shook her head.
