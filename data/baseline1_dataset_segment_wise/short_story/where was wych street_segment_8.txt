	'The Gallows Ring' was not popular in Wapping, for the reason that many of their depredations had been inflicted upon their own class. When Meadows and Harry Jones took it into their heads to do a little wild prancing they took the trouble to go up into the West-end. They considered 'The Gallows Ring' an ungentlemanly set; nevertheless, they always treated them with a certain external deferenceâan unpleasant crowd to quarrel with.
