There was once a Dog who was very fond of eggs. He visited the hen house very often and at last got so greedy that he would swallow the eggs whole.\n\n\tOne day the Dog wandered down to the seashore. There he spied an Oyster. In a twinkling the Oyster was resting in the Dog's stomach, shell and all.\n\n\tIt pained the Dog a good deal, as you can guess.\n\n\t'I've learned that all round things are not eggs,' he said groaning.\n\n\tAct in haste and repent at leisureâ€”and often in pain.\n\n\t               Add  The Dog And The Oyster to your library.
