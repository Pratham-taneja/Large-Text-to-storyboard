A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.\n\n\tThe bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.\n\n\tNow he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.\n\n\t'What a fool I am,' he said. 'Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.'\n\n\tAnd off he walked very, very scornfully.\n\n\tThere are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.\n\n\tYou may also enjoy reading the parody poem of this fable, titled The Ambitious Fox and the Unapproachable Grapes.\n\n\t               Add  The Fox And The Grapes to your library.
