A Mule had had a long rest and much good feeding. He was feeling very vigorous indeed, and pranced around loftily, holding his head high.\n\n\t'My father certainly was a full-blooded racer,' he said. 'I can feel that distinctly.'\n\n\tNext day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very downhearted indeed.\n\n\t'I was mistaken,' he said. 'My father was an Ass after all.'\n\n\tBe sure of your pedigree before you boast of it.\n\n\t               Add  The Mule to your library.
