A Stag was chased by the hounds, and took refuge in a cave, where he hoped to be safe from his pursuers. Unfortunately the cave contained a Lion, to whom he fell an easy prey. 'Unhappy that I am,' he cried, 'I am saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of a Lion.'\n\n\tOut of the frying-pan, into the fire.
