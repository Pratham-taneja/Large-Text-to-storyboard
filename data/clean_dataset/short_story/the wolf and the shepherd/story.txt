A Wolf, lurking near the Shepherd's hut, saw the Shepherd and his family feasting on a roasted lamb.\n\n\t'Aha!' he muttered. 'What a great shouting and running about there would have been, had they caught me at just the very thing they are doing with so much enjoyment!'\n\n\tMen often condemn others for what they see no wrong in doing themselves.\n\n\t               Add  The Wolf And The Shepherd to your library.
