So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said,   asked the youth.  After this he again walked a long time, and said,  until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang. Then said he,   And he again got some blows on his back.  said he. \n\n\tAgain the youth walked on for a long while and said,  Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse. The youth said,   and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see out of his eyes.  \n\n\tSo he walked on, and always said,  And he came to a cart full of people, so he said,  Then the cart pushed him into a hole, and the driver took his whip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a-travelling again.\n\n\t6.5
