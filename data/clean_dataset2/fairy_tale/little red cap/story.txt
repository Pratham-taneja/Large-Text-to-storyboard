Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called \n\n\tOne day her mother said to her, \n\n\t said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\n\n\tThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n\n\t said he.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t replied Little Red-Cap.\n\n\tThe wolf thought to himself,  So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said, \n\n\tLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought,  and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n\n\tMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.\n\n\t\n\n\t replied the wolf. \n\n\t called out the grandmother, \n\n\tThe wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\n\tLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n\n\tShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself,  She called out,  but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n\t she said, \n\n\t was the reply.\n\n\t she said.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\n\n\tWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself,  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.  said he.  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying,  and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's body, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he fell down at once, and fell dead.\n\n\tThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself, \n\n\t* * * * * * *\n\n\tIt is also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said  to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.  said the grandmother,  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried,  But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child,  Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and never did anything to harm any one.\n\n\tYou may also enjoy our collection of Favorite Fairy Tales.\n\n\t8.9
