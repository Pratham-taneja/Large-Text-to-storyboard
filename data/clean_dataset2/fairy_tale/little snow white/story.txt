Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, \n\n\tSoon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony; and she was therefore called Little Snow-white. And when the child was born, the Queen died.\n\n\tAfter a year had passed the King took to himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said—-\n\n\t\n\n\tthe looking-glass answered—-\n\n\t\n\n\tThen she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.\n\n\tBut Snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass —\n\n\t\n\n\tit answered—-\n\n\t But more beautiful still is Snow-white, as I ween.Take the child away into the forest; I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a token.Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.Run away, then, you poor child.The wild beasts will soon have devoured you,Who has been sitting on my chair?Who has been eating off my plate?Who has been taking some of my bread?Who has been eating my vegetables?Who has been using my fork?Who has been cutting with my knife?Who has been drinking out of my mug?Who has been getting into my bed?Somebody has been lying in my bed too.Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!what a lovely child!My name is Snow-white,How have you come to our house?If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and clean, you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.Yes,with all my heart,Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you are here; be sure to let no one come in.Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well,\n\n\tAnd none is so fair as she.Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap.Good-day my good woman, what have you to sell?Good things, pretty things,stay-laces of all colours,I may let the worthy old woman in,Child,what a fright you look; come, I will lace you properly for once.Now I am the most beautiful,The old pedler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen; take care and let no one come in when we are not with you.Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well,\n\n\tAnd none is so fair as she.But now,I will think of something that shall put an end to you,Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!Go away; I cannot let any one come in.I suppose you can look,Now I will comb you properly for once.You paragon of beauty,you are done for now,Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well,\n\n\tAnd none is so fair as she.Snow-white shall die,even if it costs me my life!I cannot let any one in; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.It is all the same to me,I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one.No,I dare not take anything.Are you afraid of poison?look, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood! this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again.Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all.We could not bury her in the dark ground,Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession.Oh, heavens, where am I?You are with me,I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest art thou, But the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow.'\n\n\tThen the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched, that she knew not what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young Queen. And when she went in she knew Snow-white; and she stood still with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before her. Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance until she dropped down dead.\n\n\tWe offer an alternate version that may be more appropriate for younger children in our Short Stories for Children, Snow White\n\n\t8.8
