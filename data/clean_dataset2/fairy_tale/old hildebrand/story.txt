Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson of the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for a long while to spend a whole day happily with her. The peasant woman, too, was quite willing. One day, therefore, he said to the woman, \n\n\t said the woman promptly. Now therefore on the Wednesday, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and lamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when Sunday came the woman said,  On that the peasant said, \n\n\t said the woman,  So the peasant went to the sermon, and the parson began to preach and said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any one else, and would make a pilgrimage to the Göckerli hill in Italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might be, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was over, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer.\n\n\tThen no one was more rejoiced than the peasant, and after the service was over, he went at once to the parson, who gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer. After that he went home, and even at the house door he cried,  and thereupon he went away. He was, however, hardly gone before the woman got up, and the parson was there directly.\n\n\tBut now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the peasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to get the sooner to the Göckerli hill, and on his way he met his gossip. His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming from the market, where he had sold his eggs.  said the gossip, \n\n\t said the peasant,   said the egg-merchant to the peasant, \n\n\t said the peasant. \n\n\t said the gossip,  So that was settled, and the gossip put the peasant into his egg-basket and carried him home.\n\n\tWhen they got to the house, hurrah! but all was going merry there! The woman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the parson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him. The gossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there.  said the egg-merchant, \n\n\t said the woman,  Then she placed the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by the stove. The parson, however, and the woman, were as merry as possible. At length the parson said,   said the woman, \n\n\t said the parson once more, \n\n\tOn that the woman began and sang,\n\n\t\n\n\tThereupon the parson sang,\n\n\t\n\n\tHallelujah.\n\n\tThen the gossip who was in the background began to sing (but I ought to tell you the peasant was called Hildebrand), so the gossip sang,\n\n\t\n\n\tHallelujah.\n\n\tAnd then the peasant sang from his basket,\n\n\t\n\n\tHallelujah.\n\n\tAnd he got out of the basket, and cudgelled the parson out of the house.\n\n\t9.2
