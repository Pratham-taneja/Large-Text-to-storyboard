Once upon a time, a widow had an only son whose name was Aladdin. They were very poor and lived from hand to mouth, though Aladdin did what he could to earn some pennies, by picking bananas in faraway places.\n\n\tOne day, as he was looking for wild figs in a grove some way from the town, Aladdin met a mysterious stranger. This smartly dressed dark-eyed man with a trim black beard and a splendid sapphire in his turban, asked Aladdin an unusual question:\n\n\t he ordered. \n\n\t exclaimed Aladdin. \n\n\t The stranger helped Aladdin lift the manhole cover, for it was very heavy. Slim and agile as he was, the boy easily went down. His feet touched stone and he carefully made his way down some steps . . . and found himself in a large chamber. It seemed to sparkle, though dimly lit by the flickering light of an old oil lamp. When Aladdin's eyes became used to the gloom, he saw a wonderful sight: trees dripping with glittering jewels, pots of gold and caskets full of priceless gems. Thousands of precious objects lay scattered about. It was a treasure trove! Unable to believe his eyes, Aladdin was standing dazed when he heard a shout behind him.\n\n\t Surprised and suspicious, for why should the stranger, out of all such a treasure want only an old lamp, Aladdin wondered. Perhaps he was a wizard. He decided to be on his guard. Picking up the lamp, he retraced his steps up to the entrance.\n\n\t urged the wizard impatiently.  he began to shout, thrusting out his arm to grab it, but Aladdin cautiously drew back.\n\n\t\n\n\t snapped the stranger, slamming down the manhole cover, never noticing that, as he did so, a ring slid off his finger. A terrified Aladdin was left in pitch darkness, wondering what the wizard would do next. Then he trod on the ring. Aimlessly putting it on his finger, he twisted it round and round. Suddenly the room was flooded with a rosy light and a great genie with clasped hands appeared on a cloud.\n\n\t said the genie.\n\n\tNow astoundede, Aladdin could only stammer:\n\n\t In a flash he was back in his own home, though the door wa tightly shut.\n\n\t called his mother from the kitchen stove, the minute she set eyes on him. Excitedly, her son told her of his adventures.\n\n\t his mother asked. Aladdin clapped a hand to his brow. For all he had brought home was the old oil lamp \n\n\t and the widow began to rub the lamp.\n\n\tSuddenly out shot another genie, in a cloud of smoke.\n\n\t And the genie bowed respectfully, awaiting Aladdin's orders. The boy and his mother gaped wordlessly at this incredible apparition, then the genie said with a hint of impatience in his voice.\n\n\t Aladdin gulped, then said:\n\n\t His mother not having yet begun to cook the dinner, went on to say: \n\n\tFrom that day on, the widow and her son had everything they could wish for: food, clothes and a fine home, for the genie of the lamp granted them everything they asked him. Aladdin grew into a tall handsome young man and his mother felt that he ought to find himself a wife, sooner or later.\n\n\tOne day, as he left the market, Aladdin happened to see the Sultan's daughter Halima in her sedan chair being carried through the streets. He only caught a fleeting glimpse of the princess, but it was enough for him to want to marry her. Aladdin told his mother and she quickly said:\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd indeed, the Sultan was easily persuaded by a casket full of big diamonds to admit the widow to the palace. However, when he learned why she had come, he told the widow that her son must bring proof of his power and riches. This was mostly the Chamberlain's idea, for he himself was eager to marry the beautiful black-eyed Sultan's daughter.\n\n\the must send me forty slaves tomorrow. Every slave must bring a box of precious stones. And forty Arab warriors must escort the treasure.Where wlll they live?Old lamps for new,Take me to the place where the wizard has hidden my wife,Psst! Psst!Aladdin! It's you . . .!Ssh. Don't let him hear you. Take this powder and put it into his tea. Trust me.The lamp! At last,Welcome back, Master!Why did you leave me at another's service for so long?Welcome,I'm glad to see you again. I've certainly missed you! It's just as well I have you by me again.At your command,First, put this wicked wizard in chains and take him far away where he'll never be found again.What's going on? Who is that genie?Don't worry, everything is all right,Can we return to our own kingdom?The magic that brought you here will take you back, but with me at your side, forever.I told you Aladdin's fortune couldn't last.Take my wife, myself and the palace back to our own land, as fast as you can.In a flash, Sire,' replied the genie. At the snap of a finger, the palace rose into the air and sped over the Sultan's kingdom, above the heads of his astonished subjects. It gently floated down to earth and landed on its old site. Aladdin and Halima rushed to embrace the Sultan.\n\n\tTo this very day, in that distant country, you can still admire the traces of an ancient palace which folk call the palace that came from the skies.\n\n\t8.9
