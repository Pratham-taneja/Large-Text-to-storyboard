A countryman one day said to his little puppies,  Then the little dogs said,  The countryman said,  Then the little dogs again said,  But the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might. But at that very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and beat them and treated them very hardly. And when they were outside the house, the little dogs said to the countryman,  Then the countryman laughed and said,  So they just had to run away.\n\n\t5.7
