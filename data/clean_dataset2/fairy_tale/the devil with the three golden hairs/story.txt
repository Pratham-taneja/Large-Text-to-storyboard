There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son; and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the King's daughter for his wife. It happened that soon afterwards the King came into the village, and no one knew that he was the King, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, \n\n\tThe King, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said,  At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought,  they at last consented, and gave him the child.\n\n\tThe King put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought, \n\n\tThe box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it. And it floated to within two miles of the King's chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a stand-still at the mill-dam. A miller's boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively. He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said,  They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.\n\n\tIt happened that once in a storm, the King went into the mill, and he asked the mill-folk if the tall youth was their son.  answered they, \n\n\tThen the King knew that it was none other than the luck-child which he had thrown into the water, and he said,   answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness. Then the King wrote a letter to the Queen, wherein he said, \n\n\tThe boy set out with this letter; but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest. In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage. When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone. She started when she saw the boy, and said,   he answered,   said the woman,   said the boy,  and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.\n\n\tSoon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there?  said the old woman,  The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death. Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King's daughter. Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.\n\n\tAnd the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King's daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment.\n\n\tAfter some time the King returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter.  said he; \n\n\tSo the Queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it. The King read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other. He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it.  answered he;  The King said in a passion,  In this way the King hoped to be rid of him for ever. But the luck-child answered,  thereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.\n\n\tThe road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  answered the luck-child.  said the watchman,   answered he; \n\n\tThen he went farther and came to another town, and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew.  answered he.   answered he; \n\n\tThen he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go. The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  answered he.  said the ferryman,   answered he; \n\n\tWhen he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell. It was black and sooty within, and the Devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.  said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.  answered he,   said she; \n\n\tShe changed him into an ant and said,   answered he, \n\n\t answered she, \n\n\tAs the evening came on, the devil returned home. No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.  said he;  Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything. His grandmother scolded him.  said she, \n\n\tWhen he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother's lap, and before long he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily. Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down near her.  cried the devil,   answered the grandmother,   said the devil.   answered the devil; \n\n\tHe went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook. Then she pulled the second hair out.  cried the devil angrily.  said she,   asked he.   answered the devil. \n\n\tThe grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored. Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out. The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said,   asked he, and was quite curious.   answered the devil;  As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old serpent alone, and he slept until daybreak.\n\n\tWhen the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the folds of her dress, and gave the luck-child his human shape again.  said she.   answered he,   said she,  He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need, and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately.\n\n\tWhen he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer.  said the luck-child,  and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil's advice: \n\n\tHe went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer. So he told him what he had heard from the devil:  Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him.\n\n\tAt last he came to the town whose well was dry. He told the watchman what the devil had said:  The watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold.\n\n\tAt last the luck-child got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything. To the King he took what he had asked for, the devil's three golden hairs, and when the King saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said,   answered he,   said the King; and he was quite eager about it.  answered he.  The greedy King set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across. The ferry-man came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang out. But from this time forth the King had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins. Perhaps he is ferrying still? If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him.\n\n\t7.9
