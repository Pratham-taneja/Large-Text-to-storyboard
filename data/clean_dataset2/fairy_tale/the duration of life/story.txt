When God had created the world and was about to fix the length of each creature's life, the ass came and asked,   replied God;   answered the ass,  Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years. The ass went away comforted, and the dog appeared.  said God to him.   answered the dog,  God saw that he was right, and released him from twelve years of life. Then came the monkey.  said the Lord to him.   he answered,  God was gracious and took off ten.\n\n\tAt last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged God to appoint his time for him.  said the Lord.   cried man,   said God.  replied the man.    said God,  The man went away, but was not satisfied.\n\n\tSo man lives seventy years. The first thirty are his human years, which are soon gone; then is he healthy, merry, works with pleasure, and is glad of his life. Then follow the ass's eighteen years, when one burden after another is laid on him, he has to carry the corn which feeds others, and blows and kicks are the reward of his faithful services. Then come the dog's twelve years, when he lies in the corner, and growls and has no longer any teeth to bite with, and when this time is over the monkey's ten years form the end. Then man is weak-headed and foolish, does silly things, and becomes the jest of the children.\n\n\t8.7
