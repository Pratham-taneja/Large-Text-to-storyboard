The fox once came to a meadow in which was a flock of fine fat geese, on which he smiled and said,  The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives. But the fox would listen to nothing, and said,  At length one of them took heart and said,   said the fox,  Then the first began a good long prayer, for ever saying,  and as she would make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began also,  The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling together.\n\n\tWhen they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but at present they are still praying without stopping.'\n\n\t9.2
