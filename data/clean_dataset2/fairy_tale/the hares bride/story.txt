There was once a woman and her daughter who lived in a pretty garden with cabbages; and a little hare came into it, and during the winter time ate all the cabbages. Then says the mother to the daughter,  The girl says to the little hare,  Says the hare,  The girl will not do it. Next day the hare comes again and eats the cabbages, then says the mother to the daughter,  The girl says to the hare,  The little hare says,  The maiden refuses. The third day the hare comes again, and eats the cabbages. On this the mother says to the daughter,  Says the maiden,  Says the little hare,  The girl seats herself on the little hare's tail, and then the hare takes her far away to his little hut, and says,  Then all the wedding-guests assembled. (Who were the wedding-guests?) That I can tell you as another told it to me. They were all hares, and the crow was there as parson to marry the bride and bridegroom, and the fox as clerk, and the altar was under the rainbow.\n\n\tThe girl, however, was sad, for she was all alone. The little hare comes and says,  The bride says nothing, but weeps. The little hare goes away. The little hare comes back and says,  The bride again says nothing, and weeps. The little hare goes away. The little hare comes back and says,  Then the bride says nothing, and the hare goes away, but she dresses a straw-doll in her clothes, and gives her a spoon to stir with, and sets her by the pan with the millet-seed, and goes back to her mother. The little hare comes once more and says,  and gets up, and strikes the doll on the head so that her cap falls off.\n\n\tThen the little hare sees that it is not his bride, and goes away and is sorrowful.\n\n\t4.8
