There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him diligently and honestly: He was every morning the first out of bed, and the last to go to rest at night; and, whenever there was a difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he was always the first to set himself to it. Moreover, he never complained, but was contented with everything, and always merry.\n\n\tWhen a year was ended, his master gave him no wages, for he said to himself,  The servant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had done it the first; and when at the end of this, likewise, he received no wages, he made himself happy, and still stayed on.\n\n\tWhen the third year also was past, the master considered, put his hand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out. Then at last the servant said, \n\n\t answered the old miser;  And he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three farthings, saying, \n\n\tThe honest servant, who understood little about money, put his fortune into his pocket, and thought,  So on he went, up hill and down dale; and sang and jumped to his heart's content. Now it came to pass that as he was going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to him,   answered the servant;   the dwarf asked him.   said the dwarf, \n\n\tAnd as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the old man, he gave him the three farthings, saying, \n\n\tThen the little man said, \n\n\t said the servant, \n\n\t said the dwarf; and put his hand into the bush, and only think, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready, just as if they had been ordered. These he gave to the servant, and then said to him, \n\n\t said the servant to himself, and went merrily onwards. Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat's-beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree.  he was exclaiming, \n\n\t said the servant,  And taking aim he pulled the trigger, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.  he said to the Jew, \n\n\t said the Jew,  Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl into the thicket.\n\n\tWhen he was fast among the thorns, the good servant's humor so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play. In a moment the Jew's legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and the more the servant fiddled the better went the dance. But the thorns tore his shabby coat from him, combed his beard, and pricked and plucked him all over the body.  cried the Jew, \n\n\tBut the servant did not listen to him, and thought,  and he began to play over again, so that the Jew had to jump higher than ever, and scraps of his coat were left hanging on the thorns.   said the servant,  and having taken the purse he went his way.\n\n\tThe Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was far off and out of sight, and then he screamed out with all his might,  and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak. As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town to the justice.\n\n\t he said, \n\n\t said the judge,   said the Jew; \n\n\tSo the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the good servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they found, too, the purse with the money upon him. As soon as he was taken before the judge he said,   cried the Jew, \n\n\tBut the judge also did not believe his tale, and said,  And because he had committed robbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be hanged. As he was being led away the Jew again screamed after him,  The servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round and said to the judge, \n\n\t said the judge.  answered the servant,  The Jew raised a great cry of  But the judge said,  However, he could not have refused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the servant.\n\n\tThen the Jew cried,  while the good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready. As he gave the first scrape, they all began to quiver and shake, the judge, his clerk, and the hangman and his men, and the cord fell out of the hand of the one who was going to tie the Jew fast. At the second scrape all raised their legs, and the hangman let go his hold of the good servant, and made himself ready to dance. At the third scrape they all leaped up and began to dance; the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping. Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them; old and young, fat and lean, one with another. The dogs, likewise, which had run there got up on their hind legs and capered about; and the longer he played, the higher sprang the dancers, so that they knocked against each other's heads, and began to shriek terribly.\n\n\tAt length the judge cried, quite out of breath,  The good servant thereupon had compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again, and stepped down the ladder. Then he went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground panting for breath, and said,   cried he;  So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief.\n\n\t10
