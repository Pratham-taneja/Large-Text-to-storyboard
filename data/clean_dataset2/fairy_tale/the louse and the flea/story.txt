A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell. Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself. On this the little flea began to scream loudly. Then said the little room-door,  \n\n\tThen the little door began to creak. On this a little broom in the corner said,  \n\n\t\n\n\tSo the little broom began to sweep frantically. Then a little cart passed by and said,  \n\n\t\n\n\tSo the little cart said,  and began to run wildly. Then said the ash-heap by which it ran,  \n\n\t\n\n\tThe ash-heap said,  and began to burn in clear flames. A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said,  \n\n\t\n\n\tThe little tree said,  and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said,  \n\n\t\n\n\tOn this the girl said,  and she broke her little water-pitcher. Then said the little spring from which ran the water,  \n\n\t\n\n\t said the spring,  and began to flow violently. And in the water everything was drowned, the girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little cart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little louse, all together.\n\n\t5.6
