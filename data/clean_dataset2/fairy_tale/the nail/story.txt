A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver. Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away.\n\n\tAt noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said,   answered the merchant; \n\n\tIn the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said,   answered the man; \n\n\tHe rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at night.  said he to himself, \n\n\tHasten slowly.\n\n\t8
