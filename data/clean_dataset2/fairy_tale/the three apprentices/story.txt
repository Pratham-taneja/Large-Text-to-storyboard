There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while travelling, and always to work in the same town. At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on. Then one of them said,  And that seemed best to the others also. They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were.   said the man,  One of them said,   replied the man,  One of the others had, however, looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse's foot and a man's foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him. The Devil, however, said,  As they were now secure, they consented, and the Devil told them what he wanted. The first was to answer,  to every question; the second was to say,  and the third,  They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full. As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat? The first replied,   said the host,  The second said,   said the host. The third said,   said the host.\n\n\tGood meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on. After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said,  the second said,  and the third,   said the host,  They, however, paid still more than he had asked. The lodgers, who were looking on, said,   said the host,  So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else but,   and  But they saw and knew all that was going on. It so happened that a great merchant came with a large sum of money, and said,  The host did as he was asked. As he was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was heavy with gold. Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below, but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment. When it was midnight, and the host thought that all were asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead; and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. When it was day there was a great outcry; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood. All the guests ran at once but the host said,  the lodgers confirmed it, and said,  The innkeeper, however, had them called, and said to them,   said the first,  said the second; and the third added,   said the host,  They were taken to prison, therefore, and were to be tried. When they saw that things were going so seriously, they were after all afraid, but at night the Devil came and said, \n\n\tThe next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said,        said the judge,  So they were taken out, and the host had to go with them into the circle. When they were taken hold of by the executioner's men, and were just going to be led up to the scaffold where the headsman was standing with naked sword, a coach drawn by four blood-red chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving so fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made signs from the window with a white handkerchief. Then said the headsman,  and  was called from the carriage also. Then the Devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman, beautifully dressed, and said,  Then said the eldest,  and he pointed to the innkeeper.  Then the judge sent the executioner's men thither, and they found it was as the apprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this, he caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off. Then said the Devil to the three, \n\n\t5.5
