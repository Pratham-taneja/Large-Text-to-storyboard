There was once on a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to try her. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs. Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, wooers presented themselves. The maid heard some one standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said,\n\n\t\n\n\tShe answered,\n\n\t\n\n\t said the fox,  The maid replied,\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tThe cat goes up the stairs trip, trap, The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,   she cried. \n\n\t\n\n\t  answered the cat, \n\n\t Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs. Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr. Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat,\n\n\t\n\n\tBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr. Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs. Fox out of the house.\n\n\tWhen old Mr. Fox was dead, the wolf came as a wooer, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs. Fox, opened it for him. The wolf greeted her, and said,\n\n\tHow comes it that alone you sit? What are you making good?In milk I'm breaking bread so sweet, Will the gentleman please come in and eat?No, thank you, Mrs. Cat,Is Mrs. Fox not at home?She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\n\n\tBewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr. Fox is no more.If she's in want of a husband now, Then will it please her to step below?Are you within, good Mistress Fox? If you're in want of a husband now,\n\n\tThen will it please you to step below?\n\n\tMrs. Fox asked,   answered the cat. \n\n\tWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good points which old Mr. Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the wooers away. At length came a young fox. Then Mrs. Fox said,   said the cat,   said Mrs. Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding-feast.\n\n\t\n\n\tThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr. Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.\n\n\t3.3
