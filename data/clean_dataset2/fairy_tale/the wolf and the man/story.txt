Once on a time the fox was talking to the wolf of the strength of man; how no animal could withstand him, and how all were obliged to employ cunning in order to preserve themselves from him. Then the wolf answered,   said the fox.  The wolf presented himself betimes, and the fox took him out on the road by which the huntsmen went daily. First came an old discharged soldier.  inquired the wolf.  answered the fox,  Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school.   At length came a hunter with his double-barrelled gun at his back, and hanger by his side. Said the fox to the wolf,  The wolf then rushed on the man. When the huntsman saw him he said,  aimed, and fired his small shot in his face. The wolf pulled a very wry face, but did not let himself be frightened, and attacked him again, on which the huntsman gave him the second barrel. The wolf swallowed his pain, and rushed on the huntsman, but he drew out his bright hanger, and gave him a few cuts with it right and left, so that, bleeding everywhere, he ran howling back to the fox.  said the fox,   replied the wolf,   said the fox. \n\n\t8.5
