 asked Dr. Farleigh, as he sat down by his patient, who reclined languidly in a large cushioned chair.  was the faintly spoken reply. And the word was repeated,-- The doctor took one of the lady's small, white hands, on which the network of veins, most delicately traced, spread its blue lines everywhere beneath the transparent skin. It was a beautiful hand--a study for a painter or sculptor. It was a soft, flexible hand--soft, flexible, and velvety to the touch as the hand of a baby, for it was as much a stranger to useful work. The doctor laid his fingers on the wrist. Under the pressure he felt the pulse beat slowly and evenly. He took out his watch and counted the beats, seventy in a minute. There was a no fever, nor any unusual disturbance of the system. Calmly the heart was doing its appointed work.  The lady moved her head from side to side two or three times.   And the lady shut her eyes, looking the picture of feebleness.       And Mrs. Carleton really looked distressed.    said the doctor, emphatically.   exclaimed Mrs. Carleton, almost shocked by the suggestion.   The doctor knew his patient.  There was a half-amused twinkle in the lady's eyes.  There was a vein of humor, and a spirit of  in Mrs. Carleton, which had once made her independent, and almost hoydenish. But fashionable associations, since her woman-life began, had toned her down into exceeding propriety. Fashion and conventionality, however, were losing their influence, since enfeebled health kept her feet back from the world's gay places; and the doctor's invitation to a ride found her sufficiently disenthralled to see in it a pleasing novelty.  she said, smiling. She had not smiled before since the doctor came in.  and Dr. Farleigh's hand was on the bell-rope before Mrs. Carleton had space to think twice, and endanger a change of thought.  said Mrs. Carleton, and she laid her head back upon the cushions in a feeble way.  replied the doctor. The maid came in.  Very languidly was the sentence spoken.   replied Dr. Farleigh.      was the free-spoken answer.   And a ghost of color crept into the face of Mrs. Carleton, while her eyes grew brighter--almost flashed. The maid came in with shawl and bonnet. Dr. Farleigh, as we have intimated, understood his patient, and said just two or three words more, in a tone half contemptuous.   It was not the ghost of color that warmed Mrs. Carleton's face now, but the crimson of a quicker and stronger heart-beat. She actually arose from her chair without reaching for her maid's hand and stood firmly while the shawl was adjusted and the bonnet-strings tied.  said the doctor, as he crowded in beside his fashionable lady companion, and took up the loose reins. He noticed that she sat up erectly, and with scarcely a sign of the languor that but a few minutes before had so oppressed her.   exclaimed Mrs. Carleton;  How charmingly the rose tints flushed her cheeks! How the light rippled in her dark sweet eyes, that were leaden a little while before! Away from the noisy streets, out upon the smoothly-beaten road, and amid green field and woodlands, gardens and flower-decked orchards, the doctor bore his patient, holding her all the while in pleasant talk. How different this from the listless, companionless drives taken by the lady in her own carriage--a kind of easy, vibrating machine, that quickened the sluggish blood no more than a cushioned rocking chair! Closely the doctor observed his patient. He saw how erectly she continued to sit; how the color deepened in her face, which actually seemed rounder and fuller; how the sense of enjoyment fairly danced in her eyes. Returning to the city by a different road, the doctor, after driving through streets entirely unfamiliar to his companion, drew up his horse before a row of mean-looking dwellings, and dropping the reins, threw open the carriage door, and stepped upon the pavement--at the same time reaching out his hand to Mrs. Carleton. But she drew back, saying,--    answered the lady.  Mrs. Carleton glanced at the patient old horse, whom the doctor was slandering, with a slightly alarmed manner.  she asked, uneasily.  and the doctor held out his hand in a persistent way. Mrs. Carleton looked at the poor tenements before which the doctor's carriage had stopped with something of disgust and something of apprehension.     The last sentence was in an undertone. Mrs. Carleton left the carriage, and crossing the pavement, entered one of the houses, and passed up with the doctor to the second story. To his light tap at a chamber door a woman's voice said,--  The door was pushed open, and the doctor and Mrs. Carleton went in. The room was small, and furnished in the humblest manner, but the air was pure, and everything looked clean and tidy. In a chair, with a pillow pressed in at her back for a support, sat a pale, emaciated woman, whose large, bright eyes looked up eagerly, and in a kind of hopeful surprise, at so unexpected a visitor as the lady who came in with the doctor. On her lap a baby was sleeping, as sweet, and pure, and beautiful a baby as ever Mrs. Carleton had looked upon. The first impulse of her true woman's heart, had she yielded to it, would have prompted her to take it in her arms and cover it with kisses. The woman was too weak to rise from her chair, but she asked Mrs. Carleton to be seated in a tone of lady-like self-possession that did not escape the visitor's observation.  asked the doctor.  was answered, in a calm, patient way; and she even smiled as she spoke.       The doctor beat his eyes to the floor, and sat in silence for some time. The heart of Mrs. Carleton was opening towards--the baby and it was a baby to make its way into any heart. She had forgotten her own weakness--forgotten, in the presence of this wan and wasted mother, with a sleeping cherub on her lap, all about her own invalid state.  said the doctor, looking up; then speaking to Mrs. Carleton, he added,--   and she reached out her arms for the baby, and removed it so gently from its mother's lap that its soft slumber was not broken. When the doctor returned he noticed that there had been tears in Mrs. Carleton's eyes. She was still holding the baby, but now resigned the quiet sleeper to its mother, kissing it as she did so. He saw her look with a tender, meaning interest at the white, patient face of the sick woman, and heard her say, as she spoke a word or two in parting,--   remarked the lady, as she took her place in the carriage.        said the doctor. Mrs. Carleton was silent for most of the way home; but thought was busy. She had seen a phase of life that touched her deeply.  remarked the doctor, as he handed her from the carriage.  replied Mrs. Carleton.  They had entered Mrs. Carleton's elegant residence, and were sitting in one of her luxurious parlors.  added the doctor. Mrs. Carleton bowed.  She did not answer.  continued Dr. Farleigh.  Mrs. Carleton looked steadily at the doctor.  she said, in a calm, firm way.  He asked the closing question abruptly.  was replied.  He hesitated.    There was no hesitation.      returned the doctor, rising.   said Mrs. Carleton, with feeling.  And it was not.
