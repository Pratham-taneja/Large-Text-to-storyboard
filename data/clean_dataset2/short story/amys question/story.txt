\n\n\tMrs. Grove called from the door that opened towards the garden. But no answer came. The sun had set half an hour before, and his parting rays were faintly tinging with gold and purple, few clouds that lay just alone the edge of the western sky. In the east, the full moon was rising in all her beauty, making pale the stars that were sparking in the firmament.\n\n\t she asked. \n\n\t said Amy's brother, who was busily at work with his knife on a block of pine wood, trying to make a boat.\n\n\tMrs. Grove went to the foot of the stairs, and called again. But there was no reply.\n\n\t she said to herself, a slight feeling of anxiety crossing her mind. So she went up stairs to looks for her. The door of Amy's bedroom was shut, but on pushing it open Mrs. Grove saw her little girl sitting at the open window, so lost in the beauty of the moonlit sky and her own thoughts that she did not hear the noise of her mother's entrance.\n\n\t said Mrs. Grove.\n\n\tThe child started, and then said quickly,--\n\n\t\n\n\t asked Mrs. Grove, as she sat down by her side, and drew an arm around her.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t said Amy.\n\n\t answered her mother, \n\n\t\n\n\t said the mother, \n\n\t Amy replied.\n\n\tHer mother went on,--\n\n\t\n\n\t answered the child. \n\n\t\n\n\t asked Amy.\n\n\t\n\n\tFor a little while after this they sat looking out of the window, both feeling very peaceful in the presence of God and his works. Then voice was heard below, and Amy, starting up, exclaimed,--\n\n\t and taking her mother's hand, went down to meet him.\n\n\tThis story is featured in our collection of Short-Short Stories to read when you have five minutes to spare.\n\n\t
