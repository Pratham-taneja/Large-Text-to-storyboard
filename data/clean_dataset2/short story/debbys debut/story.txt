On a cheery June day Mrs. Penelope Carrolland her niece Debby Wilder, were whizzing alongon their way to a certain gay watering-place, bothin the best of humors with each other and all theworld beside. Aunt Pen was concocting sundrymild romances, and laying harmless plots for thepursuance of her favorite pastime, match-making;for she had invited her pretty relative to join hersummer jaunt, ostensibly that the girl might see alittle of fashionable life, but the good lady secretlyproposed to herself to take her to the beach andget her a rich husband, very much as she wouldhave proposed to take her to Broadway and get hera new bonnet: for both articles she considerednecessary, but somewhat difficult for a poor girlto obtain.Debby was slowly getting her poise, after theexcitement of a first visit to New York; for tendays of bustle had introduced the young philosopherto a new existence, and the working-dayworld seemed to have vanished when she made herlast pat of butter in the dairy at home. For anhour she sat thinking over the good-fortune whichhad befallen her, and the comforts of this life whichshe had suddenly acquired. Debby was a truegirl, with all a girl's love of ease and pleasure;it must not be set down against her that shesurveyed her pretty travelling-suit with muchcomplacency, rejoicing inwardly that she could useher hands without exposing fractured gloves, thather bonnet was of the newest mode, needing noveil to hide a faded ribbon or a last year's shape,that her dress swept the ground with fashionableuntidiness, and her boots were guiltless of a patch,--that she was the possessor of a mine of wealthin two of the eight trunks belonging to her aunt,that she was travelling like any lady of the landwith man- and maid-servant at her command, andthat she was leaving work and care behind her fora month or two of novelty and rest.When these agreeable facts were fully realized,and Aunt Pen had fallen asleep behind her veil,Debby took out a book, and indulged in her favoriteluxury, soon forgetting past, present, and futurein the inimitable history of Martin Chuzzlewit.The sun blazed, the cars rattled, childrencried, ladies nodded, gentlemen longed for thesolace of prohibited cigars, and newspapers wereconverted into sun-shades, nightcaps, and fans;but Debby read on, unconscious of all about her,even of the pair of eves that watched her from theOpposite corner of the car. A Gentleman with afrank, strong-featured face sat therin, and amusedhimself by scanning with thoughtful gaze thecountenances of his fellow-travellers. Stout Aunt Pen,dignified even in her sleep, was a to the rising generation; but the studentof human nature found a more attractive subject inher companion, the girl with an apple-blossom faceand merry brown eyes, who sat smiling into herbook, never heeding that her bonnet was awry,and the wind taking unwarrantable liberties withher ribbons and her hair.Innocent Debby turned her pages, unaware thather fate sat opposite in the likeness of a serious,black-bearded gentleman, who watched the smilesrippling from her lips to her eyes with an interestthat deepened as the minutes passed. If his paperhad been full of anything but  and  hewould have found more profitable employment;but it wasn't, and with the usual readiness of idlesouls he fell into evil ways, and permitted curiosity,that feminine sin, to enter in and take possessionof his manly mind. A great desire seized him todiscover what book his pretty neighbor;but a cover hid the name, and he was toodistant to catch it on the fluttering leaves. Presentlya stout Emerald-Islander, with her wardrobeoozing out of sundry paper parcels, vacated theseat behind the two ladies; and it was soon quietlyoccupied by the individual for whom Satan wasfinding such indecorous employment. Peepinground the little gray bonnet, past a brown braidand a fresh cheek, the young man's eye fell uponthe words the girl was reading, and forgot to lookaway again. Books were the desire of his life;but an honorable purpose and an indomitable willkept him steady at his ledgers till he could feelthat he had earned the right to read. Like wine tomany another was an open page to his; he read aline, and, longing for more, took a hasty sip fromhis neighbor's cup, forgetting that it was astranger's also.Down the page went the two pairs of eyes,and the merriment from Debby's seemed to lightup the sombre ones behind her with a sudden shinethat softened the whole face and made it verywinning. No wonder they twinkled, for ElijahPogram spoke, and  A lowlaugh startled Debby, though it was smotheredlike the babes in the Tower; and, turning, shebeheld the trespasser scarlet with confusion, andsobered with a tardy sense of his transgression.Debby was not a starched young lady of the school, but a frank, free-hearted little body, quick to read the sincerity ofothers, and to take looks and words at their realvalue. Dickens was her idol; and for his sake shecould have forgiven a greater offence than this.The stranger's contrite countenance and respecttulapology won her good-will at once; and witha finer courtesy than any Aunt Pen would havetaught, she smilingly bowed her pardon, and,taking another book from her basket, opened it,saying, pleasantly,--As much surprised as gratified, the gentlemanaccepted the book, and retired behind it with thesudden discovery that wrongdoing has its compensationin the pleasurable sensation of being forgiven.Stolen delights are well known to be speciallysaccharine: and much as this pardoned sinner lovedbooks, it seemed to him that the interestof the story flagged, and that the enjoyment ofreading was much enhanced by the proximity of agray bonnet and a girlish profile. But Dickenssoon proved more powerful than Debby, and she wasforgotten, till, pausing to turn a leaf, the youngman met her shy glance, as she asked, with thepleased expression of a child who has shared anapple with a playmate,----and the man looked as honestlygrateful for the book as the boy would have donefor the apple.Only five words in the conversation, but AuntPen woke, as if the watchful spirit of propriety hadroused her to pluck her charge from the precipiceon which she stood.The energetic whisper reached the gentleman'sear, and he expected to be annihilated with a lookwhen his offence was revealed; but he was sparedthat ordeal, for the young voice answered,softly,-- whispered the elder lady.Debby shook her head, and murmured, --butAunt Pen had heard of matches being made in cars aswell as in heaven; and as an experienced general,it became her to reconnoitre, when one of the enemyapproached her camp. Slightly altering her position,she darted an all-comprehensive glance at the invader,who seemed entirely absorbed, for not an eyelash stirredduring the scrutiny. It lasted but an instant, yet inthat instant he was weighed and found wanting; forthat experienced eye detected that his cravat wastwo inches wider than fashion ordained, that hiscoat was not of the latest style, that his gloveswere mended, and his handkerchief neither cambricnor silk. That was enough, and sentence waspassed forthwith,--; and Aunt Pen turned to adjust avoluminous green veil over her niece's bonnet, which processalso shielded the face within from the eye of man.A curious smile, half mirthful, half melancholy,passed over their neighbor's lips; but his peace ofmind seemed undisturbed, and he remained buriedin his book Till they reached -----, at dusk. As hereturned it, he offered his services in procuring acarriage or attending to luggage; but Mrs. Carroll,with much dignity of aspect, informed him that herservants would attend to those matters, and, bowinggravely, he vanished into the night.As they rolled away to the hotel, Debby waswild to run down to the beach whence came thesolemn music of the sea, making the twilightbeautiful. But Aunt Pen was too tired to doanything but sup in her own apartment and goearly to bed; and Debby might as soon haveproposed to walk up the great Pyramid as to makeher first appearance without that sage matron tomount guard over her; so she resigned herself topie and patience, and fell asleep, wishing it wereto-morrow.At five, a. m., a nightcapped head appearedat one of the myriad windows of the ----- Hotel,and remained there as if fascinated by the miracleof sunrise over the sea. Under her simplicity ofcharacter and girlish merriment Debby possessed adevout spirit and a nature full of the real poetry oflife, two gifts that gave her dawning womanhoodits sweetest charm, and made her what she was.As she looked out that summer dawn upon theroyal marriage of the ocean and the sun, all pettyhopes and longings faded out of sight, and heryoung face grew luminous with thoughts too deepfor words. Her day was happier for that silenthour, her life richer for the aspirations that upliftedher like beautiful strong angels, and left a blessingwhen they went. The smile of the June skytouched her lips, the morning red seemed to lingeron her cheek, and in her eye arose a light kindledby the shimmer of that broad sea of gold; forNature rewarded her young votary well, and gaveher beauty, when she offered love. How long sheleaned there Debby did not know; steps from belowroused her from her reverie, and led her backinto the world again. Smiling at herself, She stoleto bed, and lay wrapped in waking dreams aschangeful as the shadows. ancing on her charnber-wall.The advent of her aunt's maid, Victorine, sometwo hours later, was the signal to be ; and she meekly resigned herself into thehands of that functionary, who appeared to regardher in the light of an animated pin-cushion, as sheperformed the toilet-ceremonies with an absorbedaspect, which impressed her subject with a senseof the solemnity of the occasion. Victorine saidat length, folding her hands with a sigh ofsatisfaction, as she fell back in an attitude ofserene triumph.Debby robeyed, and inspected herself with greatinterest and some astonishment; for there was asweeping amplitude of array about the younglady whom she beheld in the much-befrilled gownand embroidered skirts, which somewhat alarmedher as to the navigation of a vessel  while a curious sensation of beingsomebody else pervaded her from the crown ofher head, with its shining coils of hair, to the solesof the French slippers, whose energies seemed tohave been devoted to the production of marvellousrosettes.; and,with a pitying shrug, Victorine followed Debbyto her aunt's room. cried that lady,emerging from her towel with a rubicund visage.Debby obeyed, and sat mute, with the air ofa child in its Sunday-best on a week-day, pleasedwith the novelty, but somewhat oppressed with theresponsibility of such unaccustomed splendor, anduttefly unable to connect any ideas of repose withtight shoes and skirts in a rampant state of starch.--and Joe Leavenworth, a aged twenty, paused in his account of an excitingrace to make the announcement.Mr. Seguin, his friend and Mentor, as much his,senior in worldly wickedness as in years, tore himselffrom his breakfast long enough to survey thenew-comers, and then returned to it, saying,briefly,--Young Leavenworth whisked his glass into hiseye, and Mr. Seguin put down his roll to beholdthe phenomenon. Poor Debby! her first step hadbeen a wrong one.All great minds have their weak points. AuntPen's was her breakfast, and the peace of herentire day depended upon the success of that meal.Therefore, being down rather late, the worthylady concentrated her energies upon the achievementof a copious repast, and, trusting to formerlessons, left Debby to her own resources for a fewfatal moments. After the flutter occasioned bybeing scooped into her seat by a severe-nosedwaiter, Debby had only courage enough left torefuse tea and coffee and accept milk. That beingdone, she took the first familiar viand that appeared,and congratulated herself upon being ableto get her usual breakfast. With returning composure,she looked about her and began to enjoythe buzz of voices, the clatter of knives and forks,and the long lines of faces all intent upon the businessof the hour; but her peace was of short duration.Pausing for a fresh relay of toast, AuntPen glanced toward her niece with the comfortableconviction that her appearance was highly creditable;and her dismay can be imagined, when shebeheld that young lady placidly devouring a greatcup of brown-bread and milk before the eyes of theassembled multitude. The poor lady chokedin her coffee, and between her gasps whisperedirefully behind her napkin,--Debby dropped her spoon, and, hastily helpingherself from the dish her aunt pushed toward her,consumed the leathery compound with as muchgrace as she could assume, though unable torepress a laugh at Aunt Pen's disturbed countenance.There was a slight lull in the clatter, and the blithesound caused several heads to turn toward thequarter whence it came, for it was as unexpectedand pleasant a sound as a bobolink's song in a cageof shrill-voiced canaries.The  declining to accept of his repeatedoffers (probably because there was still toomuch honor and honesty in the boy,) youngLeavenworth sought out Mrs. Carroll on thePiazza, as she and Debby were strolling there anhour later. murmuredAunt Pen, as the gentleman approached with asmuch pleasure in his countenance as it was consistentwith manly dignity to express upon meetingtwo of the inferior race. said Aunt Pen,in her society-tone, after she had returned hisgreeting, and perpetrated a polite fiction,by declaring that she remembered him perfectly,for he was the image of his father.Mr. Leavenworth brought the heels of his varnishedboots together with a click, and executed the latestbow imported, then stuck his glass in his eye and staredtill it fell out, (the glass, not the eye,) upon whichhe fell into step with them, remarking,--Debby was good-natured enough to laugh; and,elated with that success, he proceeded to pourforth his stores of wit and learning in true collegianstyle, quite unconscious that the was looking him through and through with thesmiling eyes that were producing such pleasurablesensations under the mosaic studs. They strolledtoward the beach, and, meeting an old acquaintance,Aunt Pen fell behind, and beamed upon theyoung pair as if her prophetic eye even at this earlystage beheld them walking altarward in a properstate of blond white vest and bridal awkwardness.Eh? what's that? the thing,You'll be at the hop to-night, I hope, MissWilder,Yes, indeed; for dancing is one of the joys ofmy life, next to husking and making hay cried Mr. Joe, poking afterher.As she spoke, Debby looked up, expecting tomeet a glance of disapproval; but something in thesimple earnestness of her manner had recalledcertain boyish pleasures as innocent as they werehearty, which now contrasted very favorably withthe later pastimes in which fast horses, and thatlower class of animals, fast men, bore so large apart. Mr. Joe thoughtfully punched five holes inthe sand, and for a moment Debby liked the expressionof his face; then the old listlessness returned,and, looking up, he said, with an air ofennui that was half sad, half ludicrous, in one soyoung and so generously endowed with youth,health, and the good gifts of this life,--Debby's eyes were dancing with merriment;but they were demurely down-cast, and her voicewas perfectly serious.The milk of human kindness had been slightlycurdled for Mr. Joe by sundry college-tribulations;and having been  he very naturallyvibrated between the inborn jollity of histemperament and the bitterness occasioned by his wrongs.He had lost at billiards the night before, had beenhurried at breakfast, had mislaid his cigar-case,and splashed his boots; consequently the darkermood prevailed that morning, and when his counselwas asked, he gave it like one who bad knownthe heaviest trials of this Debby laughed behind her parasol at this burstof candor; but her independent nature promptedher to make a fair beginning, in spite of AuntPen's polite fictions and well-meant plans. she said,demurely. Mr. Leavenworth turned away, with a convicted sortof expression, as she spoke, and, makinga spyglass of his hand, seemed to be watchingsomething out at sea with absorbing interest. Hehad been guilty of a strong desire to discoverwhether Debby was an heiress, but had not expectedto be so entirely satisfied on that importantsubject, and was dimly conscious that a keen eyehad seen his anxiety, and a quick wit devised ameans of setting it at rest forever. Somewhatdisconcerted, he suddenly changed the conversation,and, like many another distressed creature, took tothe water, saying briskly,--As Debby spoke, Mrs. Carroll hove in sight,coming down before the wind with all sails set, andsignals of distress visible long before she droppedanchor and came along-side. The devoted womanhad been strolling slowly for the girl's sake, thoughoppressed with a mournful certainty that her mostprominent feature was fast becoming a fine copper-color; yet she had sustained herself like a Spartanmatron, till it suddenly occurred to her that hercharge might be suffering a likeHer fears, however, were groundless, for Debbymet her without a freckle, looking all the betterfor her walk; and though her feet were wet withchasing the waves, and her pretty gown the worsefor salt water, Aunt Pen never chid her for thedestruction of her raiment, nor uttered a warningword against an unladylike exuberance of spirits,but replied to her inquiry most graciously,----then added, in a stage-aside, as sheput a fallen lock off the girl's forehead, Debby's bright face clouded over, and shewakked on with so much stateliness that her escortwondered  and exerted himself to the utmost to recallher merry mood, but with indifferent success.said Debby, as she tied on her pagoda-hat, andfollowed Mrs. Carroll, who walked out of herdressing-room an animated bale of blue clothsurmounted by a gigantic sun-bonnet.Mr. Leavenworth was in waiting, and so like ablond-headed lobster in his scarlet suit that Debbycould hardly keep her countenance as they joinedthe groups of bathers gathering along the breezyshore.For an hour each day the actors and actresseswho played their different roles at the ----- Hotelwith such precision and success put off their masksand dared to be themselves. The ocean wroughtthe change, for it took old and young into its arms,and for a little while they played like children intheir mother's lap. No falsehood could withstandits rough sincerity; for the waves washed paint andpowder from worn faces, and left a fresh bloomthere. No ailment could entirely resist its vigorouscure; for every wind brought healing on its wings,endowing many a meagre life with another yearof health. No gloomy spirit could refuse to listento its lullaby, and the spray baptized it with thesubtile benediction of a cheerier mood. No rankheld place there; for the democratic sea toppleddown the greatest statesman in the land, anddashed over the bald pate of a millionnaire withthe same white-crested wave that stranded a poorparson on the beach and filled a fierce reformer'smouth with brine. No fashion ruled, but thatwhich is as old as Eden,--the beautiful fashion ofsimplicity. Belles dropped their affectations withtheir hoops, and ran about the shore blithe-heartedgirls again. Young men forgot their vices andtheir follies, and were not ashamed of the realcourage, strength, and skill they had tried to leavebehind them with their boyish plays. Old mengathered shells with the little Cupids dancing onthe sand, and were better for that innocentcompanionship; and young mothers never looked sobeautiful as when they rocked their babies on thebosom of the sea.Debby vaguely felt this charm, and, yieldingto it, splashed and sang like any beach-bird, whileAunt Pen bobbed placidly up and down in aretired corner, and Mr. Leavenworth swam to andfro, expressing his firm belief in mermaids, sirens,and the rest of the aquatic sisterhood, whose warblingno manly ear can resist.Dive for them! oh, dive for them! I shall beperfectly helpless, if they are lost!I can't dive, Aunt Pen; but there is a man,let us ask him,nervesOh, I'm very glad it's you, Sir!Our first interview opened with a laugh on myside, and our second with one on yours. I acceptthe fact as a good omen. Your friend seemed introuble; allow me to atone for my past misdemeanorsby offering my services now. But first let me introducemyself; and as I believe in the fitness of things, letme present you with an appropriate cardFrank EvanI am Debby Wilder, or Dora, as aunt prefersto call me; and instead of laughing, I ought to befour feet under water, looking for something wehave lost; but I can't dive, and my distress isdreadful, as you see.What have you lost? I will look for it, andbring it back in spite of the kelpies, if it is a humanpossibility,It is a set of teeth, Sir.Tell your aunt, if you please, that this littleaccident will remain a dead secret, so far as I amconcerned, and I am very glad to have been ofservice at such a critical moment.Now that man will have a sort of claim on us,and we must be civil, whoever he is. Dear! dear!I wish it had been Joe Leavenworth instead.Evan,--I don't remember any of our first familieswith connections of that name, and I dislike to beunder obligations to a person of that sort, forthere's no knowing how far he may presume; so,pray, be careful, Dora.I think you are very ungrateful, Aunt Pen;and if Mr. Evan should happen to be poor, it doesnot become me to turn up my nose at him, for I'mnothing but a make-believe myself just now. Idon't wish to go down upon my knees to him, butI do intend to be as kind to him as I should to thatconceited Leavenworth boy; yes, kinder even; forpoor people value such things more, as I know verywell.that Leavenworth boyPropinquity, my love, propinquity workswonders.Aunt Pen, are you a modest woman?Bless the child, what does she mean? Would you like to have a daughter of yoursgo to a party looking as I look?Why, of course I should, and be proud to ownsuch a charming creature,Ah, I see the difficulty, now; you are disturbedbecause there is not a bit of lace overthese pretty shoulders of yours. Now don't beabsurd, Dora; the dress is perfectly proper, orMadame Tiphany never would have sent it home.It is the fashion, child; and many a girl with sucha figure would go twice as decolletee, and thinknothing of it, I assure you.Aunt Pen, I think there is a better fashionin every young girl's heart than any MadameTiphany can teach. I am very grateful for allyou have done for me, but I cannot go into publicin such an undress as this; my mother would neverallow it, and father never forgive it. Please don'task me to, for indeed I cannot do it even for you.Now, Aunt Pen, you want me to look prettyand be a credit to you; but how would you like tosee my face the color of those geraniums all theevening?Why, Dora, you are out of your mind to asksuch a thing, when you know it's the desire ofmy life to keep your color down and make youlook more delicate,As she spoke, Debby tied on her little blondefichu with a gesture which left nothing more to besaid.Victorine scolded, and clasped her hands; butMrs. Carroll, fearing to push her authority too far,made a virtue of necessity, saying, resignedly,-- criedDebby, eager to atone for her seeming wilfulness,and really grateful for her escape from what seemedto her benighted mind a very imminent peril.Like a clover-blossom in a vase of camellias littleDebby looked that night among the dashing orlanguid women who surrounded her; for she possessedthe charm they had lost,--the freshness ofher youth. Innocent gayety sat smiling in her eyes,healthful roses bloomed upon her cheek, andmaiden modesty crowned her like a garland. Shewas the creature that she seemed, and, yielding tothe influence of the hour, danced to the music ofher own blithe heart. Many felt the spell whosesecret they had lost the power to divine, andwatched the girlish figure as if it were a symbolof their early aspirations dawning freshly from thedimness of their past. More than one old manthought again of some little maid whose love madehis boyish days a pleasant memory to him now.More than one smiling fop felt the emptiness of hissmooth speech, when the truthful eyes looked upinto his own; and more than one pale womansighed regretfully with herself,  asked Mrs. Carroll, asDebby dropped down beside her after a Mr. Joe, who was fanning the top of Debby'shead with the best intentions in life, took a survey,and answered readily,-- asked Mrs. Carroll, relenting at oncetoward a person who was favorably spoken of byone who did belong to her  began Mr. Joe, whosenarrative powers were not great.Mrs. Carroll glanced at Debby, and as thatyoung lady was regarding Mr. Joe with a friendlyaspect, owing to the warmth of his words, shegraciously assented, and the youth departed on hiserrand. Mr. Evan went through the ceremonywith a calmness wonderful to behold, consideringthe position of one lady and the charms of theother, and soon glided into the conversation withthe ease of a most accomplished courtier. andMr. Joe assumed the air of a martyr.Debby looked up with a wicked smile in hereyes, as she said,--Mr. Evan joined in Debby's merriment; butMr. Joe was so appalled at the sudden attack thathe could only stammer a remonstrance and beat ahasty retreat, wondering how on earth she cameto know that his favorite style of making himselfagreeable to one young lady was by decryinganother. replied Debby, demurely.Mrs. Carroll trod on her foot, and abruptlychanged the conversation, by saying, with anappearance of deep interest,--Mr. Evan had been standing before them witha composure which impressed Mrs. Carroll with abelief in his gentle blood, for she remembered herown fussy, plebeian husband, whose fortune hadnever been able to purchase him the manners of agentleman. Mr. Evan only grew a little moreerect, as he replied, with an untroubled mien,--From Debby's eyes there shot a bright glanceof admiration for the young man who could looktwo comely women in the face and serenely ownthat he was poor. Mrs. Carroll tried to appear atease, and, gliding out of personalities, expatiatedon the comfort of  and the contempt she felt for those and manymore moral reflections as new and original as theMultiplication-Table or the Westminster Catechism.To all of which Mr. Evan listened withpolite deference, though there was something inthe keen intelligence of his eye that made Debbyblush for shallow Aunt Pen, and rejoice when thegood lady got out of her depth and seized upon anew subject as a drowning mariner would a hen-coop. said Mrs. Carroll, watching a far-off individualwho seemed steering his zigzag course toward them.and Debby knit her brows with a somewhat irateexpression.What can be your objection, Dora?One of his accomplishments consists in drinkingchampagne till he is not a 'desirable partner'for any young lady with a prejudice in favor ofdecency. His moving in 'circles' is just what Icomplain of; and if he is an ornament, I prefermy society undecorated. Aunt Pen, I cannotmake the nice distinctions you would have me,and a sot in broadcloth is as odious as one in rags.Forgive me, but I cannot dance with that silver-labelled decanter again.As you please, dear; but if you refuse Mr.Ellenborough, you will be obliged to sit throughthe dance, which is your favorite, you know.Then I will sit, Aunt Pen; for that is preferableto staggering about the room with a partnerwho has no idea of the laws of gravitation.Shall I have the honor of averting either calamity?Oh, thank you!grand squareHow do you like our new acquaintance, Dora?yellow-haired laddieVery much; and I'm glad we met as we did,for it makes things free and easy, and that is soagreeable in this ceremonious place,Well, I'm delighted to hear you say so, dear,for I was afraid you had taken a dislike to him,and he is really a very charming young man, justthe sort of person to make a pleasant companionfor a few weeks. These little friendships are partof the summer's amusement, and do no harm; sosmile away. Dora, and enjoy yourself while youmay.Yes, Aunt, I certainly will, and all the morebecause I have found a sensible soul to talk to.Do you know, he is very witty and well informed,though he says he never had much time for self-cultivation? But I think trouble makes peoplewise, and he seems to have had a good deal,though he leaves it for others to tell of. I amglad you are willing I should know him, for Ishall enjoy talking about my pet heroes with himas a relief from the silly chatter I must keep upmost of the time.Of course, I should not object to your knowingsuch a person, my love; but I'd no idea JoeLeavenworth was a literary man, or had knownmuch trouble, except his father's death and hissister Clementina's runaway-marriage with herdrawing-master.That girl is what I call a surprise-party, now,She looks as mildas strawberries and cream till you come to thecomplimentary, then she turns on a fellow withthat deused satirical look of hers, and makes himfeel like a fool. I'll try the moral dodge to-morrowand see what effect that will have; for she ismighty taking, and I must amuse myself somehow,you know.How many years will it take to change thatfresh-hearted little girl into a fashionable belle,I wonder?sky-parlor.What a curious world this is!Theright seems odd and rude, the wrong respectableand easy, and this sort of life a merry-go-round,with no higher aim than pleasure. Well, I havemade my Declaration of Independence, and AuntPen must be ready for a Revolution if she taxesme too heavily.Good night, mother! I'll face temptation steadily.I'll try to take life cheerily, and do nothing thatshall make your dear face a reproach, when it looksinto my own again.tooksetmoral dodge,You took me behind the curtain too soon, andnow the paste-diamonds and cotton-velvet don'timpose upon me a bit.

It seemedso like home to run and sing with a troop oftopsy-turvy children that it did me good; and I wish youhad all been there to see.My dear Dora, spare my nerves; and if youhave any regard for the proprieties of life, don't goromping in the sun with a parcel of noisy boys. Ifyou could see what an object you are, I think youwould try to imitate Miss Clara, who is always amodel of elegant repose.Aunt Pen, don't freeze me yet,--don't takeaway my faith in simple things, but let me be achild a little longer,--let me play and sing and keepmy spirit blithe among the dandelions and therobins while I can; for trouble comes soon enough,and all my life will be the richer and the better fora happy youth.I'll play with you, Miss Dora; come and makesand pies upon the shore.

If you will be so kind;Somewhere across this great wide sea I hopeI have a brother, Fiveyears ago he left us, and we have never heardfrom him since, except to know that he landedsafely in Australia. People tell us he is dead; butI believe he will yet come home; and so I love tohelp and pity any man who needs it, rich or poor,young or old, hoping that as I do by them sometender-hearted woman far away will do by BrotherWill.Miss Dora, if you should meet a man whohad known a laborious youth, a solitary manhood,who had no sweet domestic ties to make homebeautiful and keep his nature warm, who longedmost ardently to be so blessed, and made it the aimof his life to grow more worthy the good gift,should it ever come,--if you should learn that youpossessed the power to make this fellow-creature'shappiness, could you find it in your gentle heartto take compassion on him for the love of 'BrotherWill'?I cannot tell.Will you ask yourself this question in some quiethour? For such a man has lived in the sunshine ofyour presence for eight happy weeks, andnow, when his holiday is done, he finds that theold solitude will be more sorrowful than ever,unless he can discover whether his summer dreamwill change into a beautiful reality. Miss Dora,I have very little to offer you; a faithful heart tocherish you, a strong arm to work for you, anhonest name to give into your keeping,--these areall; but if they have any worth in your eyes, theyare most truly yours forever.Dance light! for my heart it lies under your feet, love!You will trip, Miss Dora; let me tie thesestrings for you;Forgive me, if I am selfish in pressing for ananswer; but I must go to-morrow, and a singleword will change my whole future for the betteror the worse. Won't you speak it, Dora?If you catch me before I reach that rock,perhaps I will say 'Yes,'Nil desperandumI'll not be beaten, if I go to the bottom!I am sure of hernow,A very neat thing, by Jove!

Come, I'll try a race with you; andMiss Wilder will dance all the evening with thewinner. Bless the man, what's he doing downthere? Burying sunfish, hey?No, only a dead hope.Deuse take it, yes, a good many of that sortof craft founder in these waters, as I know to mysorrow;Howcould I so forget the truth I owed him? -- Shesaw Clara West watching with eager eyes for thecoming of young Leavenworth, and sighed, --  She saw AuntPen regarded her with an anxious face, and longedto say, At last, as her trouble grew, she resolved to goaway and have a quiet --a remedy whichhad served her in many a lesser perplexity; so,stealing out, she went to a grove of cedars usuallydeserted at that hour. But in ten minutes JoeLeavenworth appeared at the door of the summerhouse, and, looking in, said, with a well-actedstart of pleasure and surprise,--He paused with such an evident intention ofremaining that Debby resolved to make use of themoment, and ease her conscience of one care thatburdened it; therefore she answered his questionwith her usual directness,--Mr. Joe was guilty of the weakness of blushingviolently and looking immensely gratified; buthis rapture was of short duration, for Debby wenton very earnestly,--Joe Leavenworth had stood staring at Debbywith a troubled countenance, feeling as if all themisdemeanors of his life were about to be paradedbefore him; but, as he listened to her plea, thewomanly spirit that prompted it appealed moreloudly than her words, and in his really generousheart he felt regret for what had never seemeda fault before. Shallow as he was, nature wasstronger than education, and he admired andaccepted what many a wiser, worldlier man wouldhave resented with anger or contempt. He lovedDebby with all his little might; he meant to tellher so, and graciously present his fortune andhimself for her acceptance; but now, when themoment came, the well-turned speech he had preparedvanished from his memory, and with thebetter eloquence of feeling he blundered out hispassion like a very boy.If Debby had wanted a proof of her love forFrank Evan, she might have found it in the factthat she had words enough at her command now,and no difficulty in being sisterly pitiful towardher second suitor. she said; for Mr. Joe, feelingvery humble and very earnest, had gone downupon his knees, and sat there entirely regardlessof his personal apearance.He obeyed; and Debby stood looking up athim with her kindest aspect, as she said, moretenderly than she had ever spoken to him before,--Poor Joe choked a little, but called up anunexpected manliness, and added, stoutly,--He shook Debby's bands heartily, and hurrieddown the steps, but at the bottom paused andlooked back. Debby stood upon the thresholdwith sunshine dancing on her winsome face, andkind words trembling on her lips; for the momentit seemed impossible to part, and, with animpetuous gesture, he cried to her,--There were sudden tears in the young man'seyes, the flush of a genuine emotion on his cheek,the tremor of an ardent longing in his voice, and,for the first time, a very true affection strengthenedhis whole countenance. Debby's heart was full ofpenitence; she had given so much pain to more thanone that she longed to atone for it--longed to dosome very friendly thing, and soothe some troublesuch as she herself had known. She looked intothe eager face uplifted to her own and thoughtof Will, then stooped and touched her lover'sforehead with the lips that softly whispered, If she had cared for him, she never wouldhave done it; poor Joe knew that, and murmuringan incoherent  he rushed away,feeling very much as he remembered to have feltwhen his baby sister died and he wept his griefaway upon his mother's neck. He began hispreparations for departure at once, in a burst ofvirtuous energy quite refreshing to behold, thinkingwithin himself, as he flung his cigar-case into thegrate, kicked a billiard-ball into a corner, andsuppressed his favorite allusion to the Devil,--And so he did; for though he was no Augustineto turn in an hour from worldly hopes and climbto sainthood through long years of inward strife,yet in aftertimes no one knew how many falsesteps had been saved, how many small sins repentedof, through the power of the memory thatfar away a generous woman waited to respect him,and in his secret soul he owned that one of the bestmoments of his life was that in which little DebbyWilder whispered  and kissed him.As he passed from sight, the girl leaned herhead upon her hand, thinking sorrowfully to herself,--Full of zeal and courage, Debby caught up herhat and ran down the steps, but, as she saw FrankEvan coming up the path, a sudden panic fellupon her, and she could only stand mutely waitinghis approach.It is asserted that Love is blind; and on thestrength of that popular delusion novel heroes andheroines go blundering through three volumes ofdespair with the plain truth directly under theirabsurd noses: but in real life this theory is notsupported; for to a living man the countenance of aloving woman is more eloquent than any language,more trustworthy than a world of proverbs, morebeautiful than the sweetest love-lay ever sung.Frank looked at Debby, and  as she stretched her handsto him, though her lips only whispered verylow,--Had she required any assurance of her lover'struth, or any reward for her own, she would havefound it in the change that dawned so swiftly inhis face, smoothing the lines upon his forehead,lighting the gloom of his eye, stirring his firm lipswith a sudden tremor, and making his touch as softas it was strong. For a moment both stood verystill, while Debby's tears streamed down likesummer rain; then Frank drew her into the greenshadow of the grove, and its peace soothed herlike a mother's voice, till she looked up smilingwith a shy delight her glance had never knownbefore. The slant sunbeams dropped a benedictionon their heads, the robins peeped, and thecedars whispered, but no rumor of what furtherpassed ever went beyond the precincts of thewood; for such hours are sacred, and Natureguards the first blossoms of a human love astenderly as she nurses May-flowers underneaththe leaves.Mrs. Carroll had retired to her bed with anervous headache, leaving Debby to the watchand ward of friendly Mrs. Earle, who performedher office finely by letting her charge entirely alone.In her dreams Aunt Pen was just imbibing a copiousdraught of champagne at the wedding-breakfast ofher niece, when she was roused by the bride elect, whopassed through the room with a lamp and a shawlin her hand. she asked, dozily wondering if the carriagefor the wedding-tour was at the door so soon.As Debby spoke, the light flashed full into herface, and a sudden thought into Mrs. Carroll'smind. She rose up from her pillow, looking asstately in her night-cap as Maria Theresa is saidto have done in like unassuming head-gear. she demanded, with somewhatstartling brevity. was the equally concise reply.Mrs. Carroll fell flat in her bed, and laythere stiff and rigid as Morlena Kenwigs. Debbygently drew the curtains, and stole away leavingAunt Pen's wrath to effervesce before morning.The moon was hanging luminous and large onthe horizon's edge, sending shafts of light beforeher till the melancholy ocean seemed to smile, andalong that shining pathway happy Debby and herlover floated into that new world where all things seem divine.
