THERE was once a little boy who had taken cold by going out and getting his feet wet. No one could think how he had managed to do so, for the weather was quite dry. His mother undressed him and put him to bed, and then she brought in the teapot to make him a good cup of elder tea, which is so warming. At the same time the friendly old man who lived all alone at the top of the house came in at the door. He had neither wife nor child, but he was very fond of children and knew so many fairy tales and stories that it was a pleasure to hear him talk.  said the mother, \n\n\t asked he....\n\n\t said the old man.  asked he.\n\n\t said the mother, \n\n\t asked the boy.\n\n\t\n\n\t said the boy, promptly; \n\n\t said the old man. \n\n\t said the boy. \n\n\t\n\n\t asked the boy. And his mother laughed as she put elder flowers[177] in the teapot and poured boiling water over them. \n\n\t he cried all at once, \n\n\tThe little boy looked at the teapot and saw the lid raise itself gradually and long branches stretch out, even from the spout, in all directions till they became larger and larger, and there appeared a great elder tree covered with flowers white and fresh. It spread itself even to the bed and pushed the curtains aside, and oh, how fragrant the blossoms were!\n\n\tIn the midst of the tree sat a pleasant-looking old woman in a very strange dress. The dress was green, like the leaves of the elder tree, and was decorated with large white elder blossoms. It was not easy to tell whether the border was made of some kind of stuff or of real flowers.\n\n\t asked the boy.\n\n\t said the old man, Just such a large, blooming tree as this stands outside in the corner of a poor little yard, and under this tree, one bright sunny afternoon, sat two old people, a sailor and his wife. They had great-grandchildren, and would soon celebrate the golden wedding, which is the fiftieth anniversary of the wedding day in many countries, and the Elder Mother sat in the tree and looked as pleased as she does now.\n\n\t'Yes,' said the old woman, 'I remember it quite well; and how we watered the twigs, and one of them was a sprig of elder that took root[179] and put forth green shoots, until in time it became the great tree under which we old people are now seated.'\n\n\t'Yes, but before that we went to school,' said she, 'and then we were prepared for confirmation. How we both cried on that day! But in the afternoon we went hand in hand up to the round tower and saw the view over Copenhagen and across the water; then we went to Fredericksburg, where the king and queen were sailing in their beautiful boat on the canals.'\n\n\t'Ah yes, and I used to cry about you,' said she, 'for I thought you must be lying drowned at the bottom of the sea, with the waves sweeping over you. And many a time have I got up in the night to see if the weathercock had turned;[180] it turned often enough, but you came not. How well I remember one day the rain was pouring down from the skies, and the man came to the house where I was in service to take away the dust. I went down to him with the dust box and stood for a moment at the door,—what shocking weather it was!—and while I stood there the postman came up and brought me a letter from you.\n\n\t'Yes, and you gave him such a box on the ears that they tingled,' said the old man.\n\n\t'And then do you remember,' said he, 'when we were married, and our first boy came, and then Marie, and Niels, and Peter, and Hans Christian?'\n\n\t'And now their children have little ones,' said the old sailor. 'There are great-grandchildren for us, strong and healthy too. Was it not about this time of year that we were married?'\n\n\t\n\n\t said the little boy who had been listening.\n\n\t said the old man. \n\n\t said the Elder Mother,  And then she took the little boy out of bed and laid him on her bosom, and the blooming branches of elder closed over them so that they sat, as it were, in a leafy bower, and the bower flew with them through the air in the most delightful manner.\n\n\tThen the Elder Mother all at once changed to a beautiful young maiden, but her dress was still of the same green stuff, ornamented with a border of white elder blossoms such as the Elder Mother had worn. In her bosom she wore a real elder flower, and a wreath of the same was entwined in her golden ringlets. Her large blue eyes were very beautiful to look at. She was of the same age as the boy, and they kissed each other and felt very happy.\n\n\tThey left the arbor together, hand in hand, and found themselves in a beautiful flower garden which belonged to their home. On the green lawn their father's stick was tied up. There was life in this stick for the little ones, for no sooner did they place themselves upon it than the white knob changed into a pretty neighing head with a black, flowing mane, and four long, slender legs sprung forth. The creature was strong and spirited, and galloped with them round the grassplot.\n\n\t said the boy; \n\n\tThen they rode round the grassplot again, and the little maiden, who, we know, was Elder-tree Mother, kept crying out: Now we are near the church. There it stands on the hill, shaded by the great oak trees, one of which is half dead. See, here we are at the blacksmith's forge. How the fire burns! And the half-clad men are striking the hot iron with the hammer, so that the sparks fly about. Now then, away to the nobleman's beautiful estate!You must never forget all this.It is beautiful here in the spring,O that it were always spring in the fragrant beech groves!Here it is delightful in summer,It is lovely here also in autumn,Again,it is beautiful here in winter.It is beautiful in winter.It is beautiful here at home in spring and summer, in autumn and in winter,To-day is the golden wedding.'\n\n\tAs she placed them on the heads of the old people, each flower became a golden crown. And then she took two flowers out of her wreath and kissed them, and they shone first like silver and then like gold, and as she placed them on the heads of the old people, each flower became a golden crown. And there they sat like a king and[190] queen under the sweet-scented tree, which still looked like an elder bush. Then he related to his old wife the story of the Elder-tree Mother, just as he had heard it told when he was a little boy, and they both fancied it very much like their own story, especially in parts which they liked the best.\n\n\t said the little maiden in the tree. \n\n\tThen the old man opened his hymn book, and there lay the elder flower, as fresh as if it had only just been placed there, and Memory nodded. And the two old people with the golden crowns on their heads sat in the red glow of the evening sunlight and closed their eyes, and—and—the story was ended.\n\n\tThe little boy lay in his bed and did not quite know whether he had been dreaming or listening to a story. The teapot stood on the table, but no elder bush grew out of it, and the old man who[191] had really told the tale was on the threshold and just going out at the door.\n\n\t said the little boy. \n\n\t said his mother. ; and then she covered him up, that he should not take cold. \n\n\t asked the boy.\n\n\t said the mother, \n\n\tEnjoy our special Fairy Tales Guide, stories grouped by age recommendation.\n\n\t               Add  Elder-Tree Mother to your library.
