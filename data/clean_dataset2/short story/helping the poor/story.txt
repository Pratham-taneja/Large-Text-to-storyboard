 said Mr. Jonas, as he came bustling into the counting-room of a fellow merchant named Prescott.   inquired Mr. Prescott, with a slight coldness of manner.  said Mr. Jonas, quite warmly.  said Mr. Prescott.   inquired Mr. Jonas, who felt considerably fretted by so unexpected a damper to his benevolent enthusiasm.  answered Mr. Prescott, calmly.  said Mr. Jonas.   asked Mr. Prescott.        said Mr. Jonas.        replied Mr. Jonas, who was beginning to feel considerably worried,    said Mr. Jonas, bowing rather coldly.  pleasantly responded Mr. Prescott, as his visitor turned and left his store.  said Mr. Jonas, to himself, as he walked rather hurriedly away.  The next person upon whom Mr. Jonas called, happened to be very much of Mr. Prescott's way of thinking; and the next chanced to know something about the family for whom he was soliciting aid.  exclaimed the individual, when Mr. Jonas mentioned his errand,   asked Mr. Jonas, in surprise.   inquired Mr. Jonas.  Mr. Jonas went back to his store in rather a vexed state of mind. All his fine feelings of benevolence were stifled. He was angry with the indigent family, and angry with himself for being   said he, indignantly.  Just as he was saying this, his neighbor Prescott came into his store.  he inquired.  exclaimed Mr. Jonas.    Notwithstanding this rather discouraging testimony, Mr. Prescott made a memorandum of the street and number of the house in which the family lived, remarking as he did so:   replied Mr. Jonas, whose mind was very much roused against the man. The pendulum of his impulses had swung, from a light touch, to the other extreme.  said Mr. Prescott;   replied Mr. Jonas, in a positive tone of voice.  Mr. Prescott urged the matter no farther, for he saw that to do so would be useless. On his way home, on leaving his store, he called to see Gardiner. He found, in two small, meagerly furnished rooms, a man, his wife, and three children. Everything about them indicated extreme poverty; and, worse than this, lack of cleanliness and industry. The woman and children had a look of health, but the man was evidently the subject of some wasting disease. His form was light, his face thin and rather pale, and his languid eyes deeply sunken. He was very far from being the able-bodied man Mr. Prescott had expected to find. As the latter stepped into the miserable room where they were gathered, the light of expectation, mingled with the shadows of mute suffering, came into their countenances. Mr. Prescott was a close observer, and saw, at a glance, the assumed sympathy-exciting face of the mendicant in each.  said he, as he took a chair, which the woman dusted with her dirty apron before handing it to him.  replied the woman, in a half whining tone.   interrupted Mr. Prescott.  said the man.   replied Mr. Prescott,  And as he spoke, he turned his eyes to the woman's face, and then scanned the children very closely.  he inquired.  replied the mother.       said Mr. Prescott,  Gardiner looked slightly confused at this remark, and his wife, evidently, did not feel very comfortable under the steady, observant eyes that were on her.  said Mr. Prescott, looking at the woman.  Mr. Prescott glanced around the room, and then remarked, a little pleasantly:  The woman understood him, for the color came instantly to her face.  said the visitor, more seriously.  The woman, on whose face the color had deepened while Mr. Prescott spoke, now rose up quickly, and commenced bustling about the room, which, in a few moments, looked far less in disorder. That she felt his rebuke, the visiter regarded as a good sign.  said he, as the woman resumed her seat,  And Mr. Prescott looked inquiringly at the man.  said Gardiner, in a half reluctant tone and manner.   said the woman.   The woman fell back upon this strong assertion.   inquired the woman.  The woman asked the number of his residence, and promised to accept the offer of work.  said Mr. Prescott, cheerfully, as he arose.   said Gardiner, whose mind was becoming active with more independent thoughts.  said Mr. Prescott smiling.  Bright and early came Mrs. Gardiner on the next morning, far tidier in appearance than when Mr. Prescott saw her before. She was a stout, strong woman, and knew how to scrub and clean paint as well as the best. When fairly in the spirit of work, she worked on with a sense of pleasure. Mrs. Prescott was well satisfied with her performance, and paid her the half dollar earned when her day's toil was done. On the next day, and the next, she came, doing her work and receiving her wages. On the evening of the third day, Mr. Prescott thought it time to call upon the Gardiners.  said he, with an expression of real pleasure, as he gazed around the room, which scarcely seemed like the one he had visited before. All was clean, and everything in order; and, what was better still, the persons of all, though poorly clad, were clean and tidy. Mrs. Gardiner sat by the table mending a garment; her daughter was putting away the supper dishes; while the man sat teaching a lesson in spelling to their youngest child. The glow of satisfaction that pervaded the bosom of each member of the family, as Mr. Prescott uttered these approving words, was a new and higher pleasure than had for a long time been experienced, and caused the flame of self-respect and self-dependence, rekindled once more, to rise upwards in a steady flame.  continued Mr. Prescott.   exclaimed the poor man, in whom personal pride and a native love of independence were again awakening,   said Mr. Prescott, positively.  It required a little watching, and urging, and admonition, on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Prescott, to keep the Gardiners moving on steadily, in the right way. Old habits and inclinations had gained too much power easily to be broken; and but for this watchfulness on their part, idleness and want would again have entered the poor man's dwelling. The reader will hardly feel surprise, when told, that in three or four years from the time Mr. Prescott so wisely met the case of the indigent Gardiners, they were living in a snug little house of their own, nearly paid for out of the united industry of the family, every one of which was now well clad, cheerful, and in active employment. As for Mr. Gardiner, his health has improved, instead of being injured by light employment. Cheerful, self-approving thoughts, and useful labor, have temporarily renovated a fast sinking constitution. Mr. Prescott's way of helping the poor is the right way. They must be taught to help themselves. Mere alms-giving is but a temporary aid, and takes away, instead of giving, that basis of self-dependence, on which all should rest. Help a man up, and teach him to use his feet, so that he can walk alone. This is true benevolence.                     Add  Helping the Poor to your library.
