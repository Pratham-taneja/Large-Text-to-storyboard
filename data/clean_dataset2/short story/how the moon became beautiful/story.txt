The Moon is very beautiful with his round, bright face which shines with soft and gentle light on all the world of man. But once there was a time when he was not so beautiful as he is now. Six thousand years ago the face of the Moon became changed in a single night. Before that time his face had been so dark and gloomy that no one liked to look at him, and for this reason he was always very sad.\n\n\tOne day he complained to the flowers and to the stars—for they were the only things that would ever look in his face.\n\n\tHe said, \n\n\tThe stars answered and said,  they added, as they smiled coldly at the sorrowful Moon.\n\n\tThen the flowers smiled sweetly and said,  Still the Moon was sad. So one evening he went to see the beautiful maiden Tseh-N'io. And when he saw her he loved her at once. He said, \n\n\t answered Tseh-N'io.\n\n\tAnd so the Moon went every night to see the maiden. He knocked on her window, and she came. And when he saw how gentle and beautiful she was, his love grew stronger, and he wished more and more to be with her always.\n\n\tOne day Tseh-N'io said to her mother, \n\n\tHer mother thought so little of the question that she made no reply, and Tseh-N'io told her friends that she was going to be the Moon's bride.\n\n\tIn a few days she was gone. Her mother searched everywhere but could not find her. And one of Tseh-N'io's friends said,—\n\n\tA year and a year passed by and Tseh-N'io, the gentle and beautiful earth maiden, did not return. Then the people said, \n\n\tThe face of the Moon is very beautiful now. It is happy and bright and gives a soft, gentle light to all the world. And there are those who say that the Moon is now like Tseh-N'io, who was once the most beautiful of all earth maidens.\n\n\tThis folk tale is featured in our Children's Stories.
