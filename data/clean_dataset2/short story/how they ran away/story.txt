Two little boys sat on the fence whittling arrows one fine day. Said one little boy to the other little boy,--\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd as if satisfied at last, cautious Billy displayed his treasures, while bold Tommy did the same.\n\n\tBesides the two knives there were strings, nails, matches, a piece of putty, fish-hooks, and two very dirty handkerchiefs.\n\n\t said Tommy, eager to be off.\n\n\t asked Billy, who liked to be comfortable both night and day.\n\n\t And Tommy crammed the things back into his pockets as if there were no time to lose.\n\n\t And jumping down Billy caught up his rod, rather ashamed of his many questions.\n\n\tNo one was looking at them, and they might have walked quietly off; but that the  might be all right, both raced down the road, tumbled over a wall, and dashed into the woods as if a whole tribe of wild Indians were after them.\n\n\t panted Billy, when at last they stopped for breath.\n\n\t answered Tommy, who had read so many Boys' Books his little head was a jumble of Texan Rangers, African Explorers, and Buffalo Bills; and he burned to outdo them all.\n\n\t asked Billy, always ready with a question.\n\n\t\n\n\tThat was true; for Tommy's poor mamma was tired of trying to keep the lively little fellow in order, and had got used to seeing him come out of all his scrapes without much harm.\n\n\t said Billy, trudging after Captain Tommy, who always took the lead.\n\n\tThese eleven-year-old boys were staying with their mothers at a farm-house up among the mountains; and having got tired of the tame bears, the big barn, the trout brook, the thirty colts at pasture, and the society of the few little girls and younger boys at the hotel near by, these fine fellows longed to break loose and  as the hunters did in their favorite stories.\n\n\tAway they went, deeper and deeper into the great forest that covered the side of the mountain. A pleasant place that August day; for it was cool and green, with many brooks splashing over the rocks, or lying in brown pools under the ferns. Squirrels chattered and raced in the tall pines; now and then a gray rabbit skipped out of sight among the brakes, or a strange bird flew by. Here and there blackberries grew in the open places, sassafras bushes were plentiful, and black-birch bark was ready for chewing.\n\n\t asked Tommy, pausing at last in a little dell where a noisy brook came tumbling down the mountain side, and the pines sung overhead.\n\n\t said Billy, sitting down on a cushion of moss.\n\n\t answered sturdy Tommy, who liked to be moving all the time.\n\n\tHe took the fishing-basket, which hung over his shoulder by a strap, and opened it carefully; for good Mrs. Mullin had packed a nice lunch of bread and butter, cake and peaches, with a bottle of milk, and two large pickles slipped in on the sly to please the boys.\n\n\tTommy's face grew very sober as he looked in, for all he saw was a box of worms for bait and an old jacket.\n\n\t\n\n\t whined Billy; for losing his lunch was a dreadful blow to him.\n\n\t said Tommy, laughing at the other boy's dismal face.\n\n\t And Billy began to fix his line and bait his hook.\n\n\t said Tommy, bustling about to empty the basket and pile up their few possessions in a heap. \n\n\tThen Tommy ran off to a place near by where he had seen the berries, while Billy found a comfortable nook by the pool, and sat scowling at the water so crossly, it was a wonder any trout came to his hook. But the fat worms tempted several small ones, and he cheered up at the prospect of food. Tommy whistled while he picked, and in half an hour came back with two quarts of nice berries and an armful of dry sticks for the fire.\n\n\t he said, as the flames went crackling up, and the dry leaves made a pleasant smell.\n\n\t grumbled Billy, throwing down the four little trout, which he had half cleaned.\n\n\t said cheerful Tommy, whittling away, and feeding his fire as much like a real hunter as a small boy could be.\n\n\tWhile he worked, Billy ate berries and sighed for bread and butter. At last, after much trouble, two of the trout were half cooked and eagerly eaten by the hungry boys. But they were very different from the nice brown ones Mrs. Mullin gave them; for in spite of Tommy's struggles they would fall in the ashes, and there was no salt to eat with them. By the time the last were toasted, the young hunters were so hungry they could have eaten anything, and not a berry was left.\n\n\t said Tommy, when the last bone was polished. \n\n\tOff ran Tommy; and the other boy went slowly back to the brook, wishing with all his might he was at home eating sweet corn and berry pie.\n\n\tThe trout had evidently gone to their dinners, for not one bite did poor Billy get; and he was just falling asleep when a loud shout gave him such a fright that he tumbled into the brook up to his knees.\n\n\t roared Tommy, from the berry bushes some way off.\n\n\tBilly scrambled out, and went as fast as his wet boots would let him, to see what the prize was. He found Tommy dancing wildly round a fat gray animal, who was fighting to get his paws out of the trap, and making a queer noise as he struggled about.\n\n\t asked Billy, getting behind a tree as fast as possible, for the thing looked fierce, and he was very timid.\n\n\t said Tommy, prancing to and fro, without the least idea what to do with the creature.\n\n\t said Billy.\n\n\t And Tommy looked proudly at the bunch of gray fur scuffling in the sand.\n\n\t asked hungry Billy, ready for a fried crocodile if he could get it.\n\n\t said Tommy, who cared more for the skin to show than the best meal ever cooked.\n\n\tThe sound of a gun echoing through the wood gave Tommy a good idea,--\n\n\t\n\n\tOff they went to the camp; and catching up their things, the two hunters hurried away in the direction of the sound, feeling glad to know that some one was near them, for two or three hours of wood life made them a little homesick.\n\n\tThey ran and scrambled, and listened and called; but not until they had gone a long way up the mountain did they find the man, resting in an old hut left by the lumbermen. The remains of his dinner were spread on the floor, and he lay smoking, and reading a newspaper, while his dog dozed at his feet, close to a well-filled game-bag.\n\n\tHe looked surprised when two dirty, wet little boys suddenly appeared before him,--one grinning cheerfully, the other looking very dismal and scared as the dog growled and glared at them as if they were two rabbits.\n\n\t said the man\n\n\t answered Tommy.\n\n\t asked the man.\n\n\t said Tommy.\n\n\t And the man laughed.\n\n\t answered Tommy, proudly.\n\n\t said the man, looking interested as well as amused.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tTommy described him, and was much disappointed when the man lay down again, saying, with another laugh,--\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t said the man, who was tired and didn't want to stop for such poor game.\n\n\tAll this time Billy had been staring hard at the sandwiches and bread and cheese on the floor, and sniffing at them, as the dog sniffed at him.\n\n\t asked the man, seeing the hungry look.\n\n\t answered Billy, with tears in his eyes and a hand on his stomach.\n\n\t And the man took up his paper as if glad to be let alone.\n\n\tIt was lucky that the dog had been fed, for in ten minutes nothing was left but the napkin; and the boys sat picking up the crumbs, much refreshed, but ready for more.\n\n\t said the man, who had peeped at them over his paper now and then, and saw, in spite of the dirt and rips, that they were not farmer boys.\n\n\t answered Tommy, looking enviously from the gun to the game-bag, out of which hung a rabbit's head and a squirrel's tail.\n\n\t said the man, loading his gun with a very sober air; for he wanted to get rid of the boys and send them home.\n\n\tBilly looked alarmed; but Tommy's brown face beamed with joy as he said eagerly,--\n\n\t\n\n\tThat was true, and the man knew it. He did not really expect or want to meet a bear, but thought the idea of one would send the little fellows home at once. Finding one of them was unscared, he laughed, and said with a nod to Tommy,--\n\n\t\n\n\t cried Tommy, wild to go.\n\n\t growled Billy, very cross at being left out, yet with no desire to scramble any more.\n\n\t said the man, striding off with the dear gun and dog and bag, leaving Billy to wonder what he meant by that queer name, and Tommy to console himself with the promise made him.\n\n\t he said good-naturedly, when the man vanished.\n\n\t answered lazy Billy, settling himself on the rough bed the lumbermen had used.\n\n\t sighed Tommy, walking off to a pine-tree where some squirrels seemed to be having a party, they chattered and raced up and down at such a rate.\n\n\tHe tried his bow and shot all his arrows many times in vain, for the lively creatures gave him no chance. He had better luck with a brown bird who sat in a bush and was hit full in the breast with the sharpest arrow. The poor thing fluttered and fell, and its blood wet the green leaves as it lay dying on the grass. Tommy was much pleased at first; but as he stood watching its bright eye grow dim and its pretty brown wings stop fluttering, he felt sorry that its happy little life was so cruelly ended, and ashamed that his thoughtless fun had given so much pain.\n\n\t\n\n\tAs he thought this, Tommy smoothed the ruffled feathers of the dead thrush, and, making a little grave under the pine, buried it wrapped in green leaves, and left it there where its mate could sing over it, and no rude hands disturb its rest.\n\n\t thought Tommy, as he went back to the hut, and sat there, restringing his bow, till Billy woke up, much more amiable for his sleep.\n\n\tThey tried to find the woodchuck, but lost their way, and wandered deeper into the great forest till they came to a rocky place and could go no farther. They climbed up and tumbled down, turned back and went round, looked at the sun and knew it was late, chewed sassafras bark and checkerberry leaves for supper, and grew more and more worried and tired as hour after hour went by and they saw no end to woods and rocks. Once or twice they heard the hunter's gun far away, and called and tried to find him.\n\n\tTommy scolded Billy for not going with the man, who knew his way and was probably safe in the valley when the last faint shot came up to them. Billy cried, and reproached Tommy for proposing to run away; and both felt very homesick for their mothers and their good safe beds at Farmer Mullin's.\n\n\tThe sun set, and found them in a dreary place full of rocks and blasted trees half-way up the mountain. They were so tired they could hardly walk, and longed to lie down anywhere to sleep; but, remembering the hunter's story of the bear, they were afraid to do it, till Tommy suggested climbing a tree, after making a fire at the foot of it to scare away the bear, lest he climb too and get them.\n\n\tBut, alas! the matches were left in their first camp; so they decided to take turns to sleep and watch, since it was plain that they must spend the night there. Billy went up first, and creeping into a good notch of the bare tree tried to sleep, while brave Tommy, armed with a big stick, marched to and fro below. Every few minutes a trembling voice would call from above,  and an anxious voice would answer from below, \n\n\tAt last Billy began to snore, and then Tommy felt so lonely he couldn't bear it; so he climbed to a lower branch, and sat nodding and trying to keep watch, till he too fell fast asleep, and the early moon saw the poor boys roosting there like two little owls.\n\n\tA loud cry, a scrambling overhead, and then a great shaking and howling waked Tommy so suddenly that he lost his wits for a moment and did not know where he was.\n\n\t cried Billy, filling the quiet night with dismal howls.\n\n\tTommy looked up, expecting to behold a large bear eating his unhappy friend; but the moonlight showed him nothing but poor Billy dangling from a bough, high above the ground, caught by his belt when he fell. He had been dreaming of bears, and rolled off his perch; so there he hung, kicking and wailing, half awake, and so scared it was long before Tommy could make him believe that he was quite safe.\n\n\tHow to get him down was the next question. The branch was not strong enough to bear Tommy, though he climbed up and tried to unhook poor Billy. The belt was firmly twisted at the back, and Billy could not reach to undo it, nor could he get his legs round the branch to pull himself up. There seemed no way but to unbuckle the belt and drop. That he was afraid to try; for the ground was hard, and the fall a high one. Fortunately both belt and buckle were strong; so he hung safely, though very uncomfortably, while Tommy racked his boyish brain to find a way to help him.\n\n\tBilly had just declared that he should be cut in two very soon if something was not done for him, and Tommy was in despair, when they thought they heard a far-off shout, and both answered it till their throats were nearly split with screaming.\n\n\t cried Billy from his hook, pointing toward the valley.\n\n\t answered Tommy, glad to do anything that would put an end to this dreadful state of things.\n\n\t wailed Billy, longing to drop, but afraid.\n\n\t answered Tommy, rushing away helter-skelter, never minding where he went, and too much excited to care for any damage.\n\n\tThe moon was bright on the blasted trees; but when he came down among the green pines, it grew dark, and he often stumbled and fell. Never minding bumps and bruises, he scrambled over rocks, leaped fallen trunks, floundered through brooks, and climbed down steep places, till, with a reckless jump, he went heels over head into a deep hole, and lay there for a moment stunned by the fall. It was an old bear-trap, long unused, and fortunately well carpeted with dead leaves, or poor Tommy would have broken his bones.\n\n\tWhen he came to himself he was so used up that he lay still for some time in a sort of daze, too tired to know or care about anything, only dimly conscious that somebody was lost in a tree or a well, and that, on the whole, running away was not all fun.\n\n\tBy and by the sound of a gun roused him; and remembering poor Billy, he tried to get out of the pit,--for the moon showed him where he was. But it was too deep, and he was too stiff with weariness and the fall to be very nimble. So he shouted, and whistled, and raged about very like a little bear caught in the pit.\n\n\tIt is very difficult to find a lost person on these great mountains, and many wander for hours not far from help, bewildered by the thick woods, the deep ravines, and precipices which shut them in. Some have lost their lives; and as Tommy lay on the leaves used up by his various struggles, he thought of all the stories he had lately heard at the farm, and began to wonder how it would feel to starve to death down there, and to wish poor Billy could come to share his prison, that they might die together, like the Babes in the Wood, or better still the Boy Scouts lost on the prairies in that thrilling story, \n\n\t\n\n\tTommy's meditations ended in a series of yells as loud as his shrill little voice could make them, and he thought some one answered. But it must have been an echo, for no one came; and after another rampage round his prison, the poor boy nestled down among the leaves, and went fast asleep because there was nothing else to do.\n\n\tSo there they were, the two young hunters, lost at midnight on the mountain,--one hanging like an apple on the old tree, and the other sound asleep in a bear-pit. Their distracted mothers meantime were weeping and wringing their hands at the farm, while all the men in the neighborhood were out looking for the lost boys. The hunter on his return to the hotel had reported meeting the runaways and his effort to send them home in good season; so people knew where to look, and, led by the man and dog, up the mountain went Mr. Mullin with his troop. It was a mild night, and the moon shone high and clear; so the hunt was, on the whole, rather easy and pleasant at first, and lanterns flashed through the dark forest like fireflies, the lonely cliffs seemed alive with men, and voices echoed in places where usually only the brooks babbled and the hawks screamed. But as time went on, and no sign of the boys appeared, the men grew anxious, and began to fear some serious harm had come to the runaways.\n\n\t said Mr. Mullin, as they stopped to rest after a hard climb through the blasted grove. \n\n\t said the man with the gun, seeing his mistake too late, as people often do.\n\n\t suggested a tall fellow, who had shouted himself hoarse.\n\n\t said the farmer, hurrying toward the place where the hound was baying at something in a tree.\n\n\tIt was poor Billy, hanging there still, half unconscious with weariness and fear. The belt had slipped up under his arms, so he could breathe easily; and there he was, looking like a queer sort of cone on the blasted pine.\n\n\t exclaimed the farmer, as the tall lad climbed up, and, unhooking Billy, handed him down like a young bird, into the arms held up to catch him.\n\n\t said the hunter, who didn't take much interest in the fat boy.\n\n\tTommy's hat lay on the ground; and showing it to the dog, his master told him to find the boy. The good hound sniffed about, and then set off with his nose to the ground, following the zigzag track Tommy had taken in his hurry. The hunter and several of the men went after him, leaving the farmer with the others to take care of Billy.\n\n\tPresently the dog came to the bear-pit, and began to bark again.\n\n\t cried the men, much relieved; and rushing on soon saw the good beast looking down at a little white object in one corner of the dark hole.\n\n\tIt was Tommy's face in the moonlight, for the rest of him was covered up with leaves. The little round face seemed very quiet; and for a moment the men stood quite still, fearing that the fall might have done the boy some harm. Then the hunter leaped down, and gently touched the brown cheek. It was warm, and a soft snore from the pug nose made the man call out, much relieved,--\n\n\t\n\n\tAs he spoke, Tommy opened his eyes, gave a stretch, and said,  as calmly as if in his own bed at home. Then the rustle of the leaves, the moonlight in his face, and the sight of several men staring down at him startled him wide awake.\n\n\t he asked, looking up at the hunter with a grin.\n\n\t answered the man, giving Tommy a roll in the leaves, much pleased because he did not whine or make a fuss.\n\n\t laughed Tommy, kicking off his brown bed-clothes, and quite ready to get up now.\n\n\tThey all laughed with him; and presently, when the story was told, they pulled the boy out of the pit, and went back to join the other wanderer, who was now sitting up eating the bread and butter Mrs. Mullin sent for their very late supper.\n\n\tThe men roared again, as the two boys told their various tribulations; and when they had been refreshed, the party started for home, blowing the tin horns, and firing shot after shot to let the scattered searchers know that the lost children were found. Billy was very quiet, and gladly rode on the various broad backs offered for his use, but Tommy stoutly refused to be carried, and with an occasional  over a very rough place, walked all the way down on his own sturdy legs. He was the hero of the adventure, and was never tired of relating how he caught the woodchuck, cooked the fish, slid down the big rock, and went to bed in the old bear-pit. But in his own little mind he resolved to wait till he was older before he tried to be a hunter; and though he caught several wood-chucks that summer, he never shot another harmless little bird.\n\n\t               Add  How They Ran Away to your library.
