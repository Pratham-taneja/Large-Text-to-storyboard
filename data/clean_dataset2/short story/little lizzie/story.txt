 said Mrs. Leslie, weeping.  Mrs. Leslie was talking with a sympathizing neighbor, who responded, by saying, that she wished the tavern would burn down, and that, for her part, she didn't feel any too good to apply fire to the place herself. Mrs. Leslie sighed, and wiped away the tears with her checked apron.  she murmured,   exclaimed the neighbor, immediately.  While this conversation was going on, a little girl, not over ten years of age, sat listening attentively. After a while she went quietly from the room, and throwing her apron over head, took her way, unobserved by her mother, down the road. Where was little Lizzie going? There was a purpose in her mind: She had started on a mission.  These earnest, tearful words of her, mother had filled her thoughts. If Mr. Jenks wouldn't sell her father anything to drink,  How simple, how direct the remedy! She would go to Mr. Jenks, and ask him not to let her father have any more liquor, and then all would be well again. Artless, innocent child! And this was her mission. The tavern kept by Jenks, the laziest man in Milanville,--he was too lazy to work, and therefore went to tavern-keeping,--stood nearly a quarter of a mile from the poor tenement occupied by the Leslies. Towards this point, under a hot, sultry sun, little Lizzie made her way, her mind so filled with its purpose that she was unconscious of heat of fatigue. Not long before a traveller alighted at the tavern. After giving directions to have his horses fed, he entered the bar-room, and went to where Jenks stood, behind the counter.  inquired the landlord.  Jenks could not hide the indifference at once felt towards the stranger. Very deliberately he set a pitcher and a glass upon the counter, and then turned partly away. The stranger poured out a tumbler of water, and drank it off with an air of satisfaction.  said he.  was returned, somewhat uncourteously.   As Jenks said this, he winked to one of his good customers, who was lounging, in the bar.  The man, to whom this was addressed, was not so far lost to shame as Jenks. He blushed and looked confused, as he replied,--   said the stranger, turning to the man, whose swollen visage, and patched, threadbare garments, too plainly told the story of his sad life.  There were two or three customers in the bar besides Leslie, to whom this was addressed; and all of them, in spite of the landlord's angry and sneering countenance, treated the stranger with attention and respect. Seeing this, Jenks could not restrain himself; so, coming from behind his bar, he advanced to his side, and, laying his hand quite rudely on his shoulder, said, in a peremptory manner,--  The stranger moved aside a pace or two, so that the hand of Jenks might fall from his person, and then said, mildly,--   The landlord's face was now fiery red, and he spoke with insolence and passion.  said the stranger, good-humoredly.  At this moment a child stepped into the bar-room. Her little face was flushed, and great beads of perspiration were slowly moving down her crimson cheeks. Her step was elastic, her manner earnest, and her large, dark eyes bright with an eager purpose. She glanced neither to the right nor the left, but walking up to the landlord, lifted to him her sweet young face, and said, in tones that thrilled every heart but his,--   exclaimed Jenks, the crimson of his face deepening to a dark purple. As he spoke, he advanced towards the child, with his hand uplifted in a threatening attitude.  persisted the child, not moving from where she stood, nor taking her eyes front the landlord's countenance.   shouted Jenks, now maddened beyond self-control; and his hand was about descending upon the little one, when the stranger caught her in his arms, exclaiming, as he did so, with deep emotion,--  he added;  added the stranger, in a choking voice.   now cried the child, stretching forth her hands. In the next moment she was clinging to the breast of her father, who, with his arms clasped tightly around her, stood weeping and mingling his tears with those now raining from the little one's eyes. What an oppressive stillness pervaded that room! Jenks stood subdued and bewildered, his state of mental confusion scarcely enabling him to comprehend the full import of the scene. The stranger looked on wonderingly, yet deeply affected. Quietly, and with moist eyes, the two or three drinking customers who had been lounging in the bar, went stealthily out; and the landlord, the stranger and the father and his child, were left the only inmates of the room.  said Leslie, breaking the deep silence.  And the unhappy inebriate took his child by the hand, and led her towards the door. But the little one held back.  she said.   said the stranger.  said Leslie, in a stern yet solemn voice, as he turned and fixed his eyes upon the landlord.  returned Jenks, in a threatening tone, as he returned the gaze of Leslie.  exclaimed Leslie, in a half-despairing voice.   Jenks spoke with with an angry emphasis.  murmured the poor drunkard, as he led his child away.  Hardly had the mother of Lizzie missed her child, ere she entered, leading her father by the hand.  she exclaimed, with a joy-lit countenance, and in a voice of exultation,   Hope sprung up in her heart, on wild and fluttering wings, her face flushed, and then grew deadly pale. She sat panting for a reply.  said her husband. A pair of thin, white hands were clasped quickly together, an ashen face was turned upwards, tearless eyes looked their thankfulness to heaven.  said Leslie.   A year afterwards a stranger came again that way, and stopped at the  As before, Jenks was behind his well-filled bar, and drinking customers came and went in numbers. Jenks did not recognize him until he called for water, and drank a full tumbler of the pure liquor with a hearty zest. Then he knew him, but feigned to be ignorant of his identity. The stranger made no reference to the scene he had witnessed there a twelvemonth before, but lingered in the bar for most of the day, closely observing every one that came to drink. Leslie was not among the number.  said the stranger, speaking at last to Jenks.  was the landlord's rude answer, as he turned off from his questioner.  said the stranger to himself.   Thus spoke to the stranger one who had heard him address the landlord.  he answered.           mused the stranger, as he rode past the neat cottage of the reformed man a couple of hours afterwards. --a dark shadow swept over the stranger's face, and a shudder went through his frame.  he added as he sprung his horse into a gallop and rode swiftly onward.
