We had been to tea with some friends in Shaftesbury Terrace, and were so busy with our gossip that the evening slipped away unperceived till the clock struck half-past ten. We were two lone ladies, and had meant to leave early, as we were strangers in London and had some way to drive; so our dismay on discovering the lateness of the hour may be imagined.\n\n\tWe had not engaged a carriage to come for us, knowing that a cab-stand was near by, and that a cab would be much cheaper than the snug broughams ladies usually secure for evening use.\n\n\tOut flew the little maid to get us a cab, and we hurried on our wraps eager to be gone. But we waited and waited, for Mary Ann did not come, and we were beginning to think something had happened to her, when she came hurrying back to say that all the cabs were gone from the neighboring stand, and she had run to another, where, after some delay, she had secured a hansom.\n\n\tNow it is not considered quite the thing for ladies to go about in hansom cabs, without a gentleman to accompany them, especially in the evening; but being independent Americans, and impatient to relieve our weary hostess of our presence, we said nothing, but bundled in, gave the address,—24 Colville Gardens, Bayswater,—and away we went.\n\n\tA dense fog had come on, and nothing was visible but a short bit of muddy street, and lamps looming dimly through the mist. Our driver was as husky as if it had got into his throat, and the big, white horse looked absolutely ghostly as he went off at the breakneck pace which seems as natural to the London cab-horse as mud is to London streets.\n\n\t said my sister, who was now enjoying her first visit to this surprising city.\n\n\t I returned, feeling much secret anxiety as to the propriety of our proceeding.\n\n\t I asked, after we had driven through what seemed a wilderness of crescents, terraces, gardens, and squares.\n\n\t said M, who dearly liked to poke up the little door in the roof, which was our only means of communication with the burly, breezy cherub who sat up aloft to endanger the life of his fare.\n\n\t\n\n\tUp went the little door, and M asked blandly,—\n\n\t\n\n\t was the cheering response breathed through the trap-door (as M called it) in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\t\n\n\t—began the man.\n\n\t cried I, with the foreboding fear heavier than before.\n\n\t and down went the little door, and off rattled the cab.\n\n\tMy irrepressible sister burst out laughing at the absurdity of our position.\n\n\t I croaked, with a warning pinch.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t I answered, grimly, as a splash of mud lit upon my nose, and the cab gave a perilous lurch in cutting round a sharp corner.\n\n\tDid any one ever find a policeman when he was wanted? I never did, though they are as thick as blackberries when they are not needed.\n\n\tOn and on we went, but not a felt helmet appeared, and never did escaping fugitive look more eagerly for the North Star than I did for a gleaming badge on a blue coat.\n\n\t and I poked up the door with a vigor that would have startled the soundest sleeper.\n\n\t came the wheezy whisper, more wheezy than ever.\n\n\t\n\n\t came back the hollow mockery conveyed in those exasperating words.\n\n\tWe did stop, and a star did appear, when I, with all the dignity I could muster, stated the case and asked for aid.\n\n\t gave it civilly; but I greatly fear he did not believe that the muddy-faced woman with a croaky voice, and the blonde damsel with curls, long earrings and light gloves, were really respectable members of the glorious American Republic.\n\n\tI felt this and I could not blame him; so, thanking him with a bow which would have done credit to the noblest of my Hancock and Quincy ancestors, we went on again.\n\n\tAlas, alas, it was all go on and no stop; for although our driver had responded briskly,  to the policeman's inquiry,  he evidently did not know it, and the white horse went steadily up and down the long, wet streets, like a phantom steed in a horrid dream.\n\n\tThings really were becoming serious; midnight was approaching. I had not the remotest idea where we were, and the passers-by became more and more infrequent, lights vanished from windows, few cabs were seen and the world was evidently going to bed. The fog was rapidly extinguishing my voice, and anxiety quenching my courage. M's curls hung limp and wild about her face, and even M's spirits began to fail.\n\n\t she whispered in my ear.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tM groaned, I laughed, the ghostly horse sneezed, and I think the driver snored.\n\n\tWhen things are pretty comfortable I am apt to croak, but when every thing is tottering on the verge of annihilation I usually feel rather jolly. Such being the perversity of my fallen nature, I began to enjoy myself at this period, and nearly drove poor M out of her wits by awful or whimsical suggestions and pictures of our probable fate.\n\n\tIt was so very absurd that I really could not help seeing the funny side of the predicament, and M was the best fun of all, she looked so like a dilapidated Ophelia with her damp locks, a blue rigolette all awry, her white gloves tragically clasped, and her pale countenance bespattered with the mud that lay thick on the wooden boot and flew freely from the wheels.\n\n\tI had my laugh out and then tried to mend matters. What could we do? My first impulse was to stir up the sleeping wretch above, and this I did by energetically twitching the reins that hung loosely before our noses like the useless rudder of this lost ship.\n\n\t\n\n\tI fear that most of this impressive harangue was lost, owing to the noise of the wheels and the feebleness of my nearly extinguished voice; but it had some effect, for though the man did not seem scared by the threatened wrath of an M.P., he did feel his weak point and try to excuse it, for he answered in a gruffy, apologetic tone,—\n\n\t\n\n\t I demanded.\n\n\t\n\n\tHe didn't say —quite the reverse;—but I forgave him, for he really did seem to be making an effort, having had his nap out. An impressive pause followed, then M had an inspiration.\n\n\t\n\n\tI gave the order, and, eager to be rid of us at any price, our man rattled us up to the door at which a gray-haired gentleman was settling with his driver.\n\n\tBent on clutching this spar of salvation, I burst out of our cab and hastened up to the astonished pair. What I said I don't know, but vaguely remember jumbling into my appeal all the names of all the celebrated and respectable persons whom I knew on both sides of the water, for I felt that my appearance was entirely against me, and really expected to be told to go about my business.\n\n\tJohn Bull, however, had pity upon me, and did his best for us, like a man and a brother.\n\n\t said the worthy man, politely ignoring my muddy visage and agitated manners.\n\n\tMurmuring blessings on his head, we skipped into the respectable four-wheeler, and in a burst of confidence I offered Mr. Bull my purse to defray the expenses of our long drive.\n\n\t cried M, hiding her Roman earrings and clutching her Etruscan locket, prepared for highway robbery if not murder.\n\n\tI did see my purse again and my money, also; for that dear old gentleman paid our miserable cabby out of his own pocket (as I found afterwards), and with a final gruff  the pale horse and his beery driver vanished in the mist. It is, and always will be my firm belief that it was a phantom cab, and that it is still revolving ceaselessly about London streets, appearing and disappearing through the fog, to be hailed now and then by some fated passenger, who is whisked to and fro, bewildered and forlorn, till rescued, when ghostly steed and phantom cab vanish darkly.\n\n\t and the good old gentleman dismissed us with a paternal smile.\n\n\tWith a feeling of relief I fell back, exhausted by our tribulations.\n\n\t said M, after a period of repose.\n\n\t I responded, flattening my nose against the pane, though I literally could not see one inch before that classical feature.\n\n\t said M, settling herself for a doze.\n\n\tI groaned dismally, and registered a vow to spend all my substance in future on the most elegant and respectable broughams procurable for money, with a gray-haired driver pledged to temperance, and a stalwart footman armed with a lantern, pistol, directory, and map of London.\n\n\tAll of a sudden the cab stopped; the driver, not being a fixture, descended, and coming to the window, said, civilly,—\n\n\t\n\n\t—\n\n\t\n\n\t remarked M, in such a tone of sleepy resignation that I shook her on the spot.\n\n\tAnother jaunt up and down, fog getting thicker, night later, one woman sleepier and the other crosser every minute, but still no haven hove in sight. Presently the cab stopped with a decided bump against the curb-stone, and the driver reappeared, saying, with respectful firmness,—\n\n\t\n\n\t I answered, getting out with the calmness of despair.\n\n\t suggested M, waking from her doze.\n\n\tReady now for any desperate measure, I rushed up the steps, tried vainly to read the number, but could not, and rang the bell with the firm determination to stay in that house till morning at any cost.\n\n\tSteps came running down, the door flew open, and I was electrified at beholding the countenance of my own buxom landlady.\n\n\t she cried, as I stood staring at her, dumb with surprise and relief.\n\n\t I answered, dropping into a hall chair, and feeling as I imagine Robinson Crusoe did when he got home.\n\n\tOf course that civil cabby cheated me abominably. I knew it at the time, but never protested; for I was so glad and grateful at landing safely I should have paid a pound if he had asked it.\n\n\tNext day we were heroines, and at breakfast alternately thrilled and convulsed the other boarders by a recital of our adventures. But the  got so well laughed at that they took great care never to ride in hansom cabs again, or get lost in the fog.\n\n\t               Add  Lost in a London Fog to your library.
