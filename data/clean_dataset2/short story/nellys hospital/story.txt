Nelly sat beside her mother picking lint; butwhile her fingers flew, her eyes often lookedwistfully out into the meadow, golden withbuttercups, and bright with sunshine. Presently shesaid, rather bashfully, but very earnestly, I think I can safely promise that, my dear,Since brother Will came home with his lamefoot, and I've helped you tend him, I've heard agreat deal about hospitals, and liked it very much.To-day I said I wanted to go and be a nurse, likeAunt Mercy; but Will laughed, and told me I'dbetter begin by nursing sick birds and butterfliesand pussies before I tried to take care of men. Idid not like to be made fun of, but I've beenthinking that it would be very pleasant to have alittle hospital all my own, and be a nurse in it,because, if I took pains, so many pretty creaturesmight be made well, perhaps. Could I, mamma?Yes, Nelly, it will be a propercharity for such a young Samaritan, and you maylearn much if you are in earnest. You must studyhow to feed and nurse your little patients, elseyour pity will do no good, and your hospital becomea prison. I will help you, and Tony shallbe your surgeon.O mamma, how good you always are to me!Indeed, I am in truly earnest; I will learn,I will be kind, and may I go now and begin?You may, but tell me first where will youhave your hospital?In my room, mamma; it is so snug and sunny,and I never should forget it there,You must not forget it anywhere. I thinkthat plan will not do. How would you like tofind caterpillars walking in your bed, to hear sickpussies mewing in the night, to have beetles clingingto your clothes, or see mice, bugs, and birdstumbling downstairs whenever the door wasopen?Let us have theold summer-house! My doves only use the upperpart, and it would be so like Frank in the storybook.Please say yes again, mamma.jollyWhat must we do first?Clear out the rubbish, miss,Here it goes, then,Just wait a bit, and let me take the lead,miss. You hand me things, I'll pile 'em in thebarrow and wheel 'em off to the barn; then itwill save time, and be finished up tidy.What next?I'll sweep up while you see if Polly cancome and scrub the room out. It ought tobe done before you stay here, let alone thepatients.So it had,Will says the wards--that meansthe rooms, Tony--are scrubbed every day ortwo, and kept very clean, and well venti-some-thing--I can't say it; but it means having a plentyof air come in. I can clean windows while Pollymops, and then we shall soon be done. How fine it looks! I'd almost like to fall sick for the sake ofstaying here,Now, whatsort of beds are you going to have, miss? answered Nelly, lookinganxious.Tony could hardly help shouting at the idea;but, rather than trouble his little mistress, he saidvery soberly:  said Nelly, unwillingthat a moment should be lost.I think they will know that it is a hospital,and be too kind to hurt or frighten their neighbors,Yes, we must have the nettings. I'll askmamma for some lace,Mamma says that the best beds will be littlebaskets, boxes, cages, and any sort of thing thatsuits the patients; for each will need different careand food and medicine. I have not basketsenough, so, as I cannot have pretty white beds, Iam going to braid pretty green nests for mypatients, and, while I do it, mamma thought you'dread to me the pages she has marked, so that wemay begin right.Yes, miss; I like that. But what is the ribbonfor?O, that's for you. Will says that, if you areto be an army surgeon, you must have a greenband on your arm; so I got this to tie on when weplay hospital.Good night,Do you expect your patients to come to you,Nelly?No, I shall go and look for them. I oftensee poor things suffering in the garden, and thewood, and always feel as if they ought to be takencare of, as people are.You won't like to carry insane bugs, lametoads, and convulsive kittens in your hands, andthey would not stay on a stretcher if you hadone. You should have an ambulance and bea branch of the Sanitary Commission,Yes, I will be aSanitary. This little cart of mine shall be myamb'lance, and I'll never let my water-barrels goempty, never drive too fast, or be rough with mypoor passengers, like some of the men you tellabout. Does this look like an ambulance, Will?Not a bit, but it shall, if you and mammalike to help me. I want four long bits of cane, asquare of white cloth, some pieces of thin wood,and the gum-pot,U.S. San. Com.Nine o'clock already. Bless me, what ashort evening this has been,And such a happy one,Thank you very, very much, dear Will. I onlywish my little amb'lance was big enough foryou to go in,--I'd so like to give you the firstride.Nothing I should like better, if it were possible,though I've a prejudice against ambulances ingeneral. But as I cannot ride, I'll try and hop outto your hospital to-morrow, and see how you geton,Where shall you go to look for your first loadof sick folks, miss?All round the garden first, then through thegrove, and home across the brook. Do you thinkI can find any patients so? I know you will. Good night, miss,Good speed!How I wonder what I shall find first,Now every one will know about the hospitaland be glad to see me coming,I think you are either faint from the heat ofthis thick coat of yours, or that you are going tomake a cocoon of yourself, Mr. Fuzz,Now I want to see you turn into a butterfly, soI shall take you, and if get lively again I willlet you go. I shall play that you have given outon a march, as the soldiers sometimes do, andbeen left behind for the Sanitary people to see to.Dear me, what shall I do for him?He acts as baby did when she was soilll, and mamma put her in a warm bath. I haven'tgot my little tub here, or any hot water, and I'mafraid the beetle would not like it if I had. Perhapshe has pain in his stomach; I'll turn him over,and pat his back, as nurse does baby's when shecries for pain like that.He is a rebel, I wonder if I ought to be goodto him,Will said there were sickrebels in his hospital, and one was very kind tohim. It says, too, in my little book, 'Love yourenemies.' I think snakes are mine, but I guess I'lltry and love him because God made him. Some boywill kill him if I leave him here, and then perhapshis mother will be very sad about it. Come,poor worm, I wish to help you, so be patient, anddon't frighten me.Queek,queek!You darling thing, did you fall out of yournest and hurt your wing?Queek, queek, queek!queekedYes,that is afairy tent, and in it I may find a baby elf sickwith whooping-cough or scarlet-fever. Howsplendid it would be! only I could never nursesuch a dainty thing.I shall call the mice my Babes in the Wood,because they are lost and covered up with leaves, Nelly knew this was a joke of Will's,but welcomed the ancient mariner, and calledTony to help her get him in.All that morning they were very busy settlingthe new-comers, for both people and books hadto be consulted before they could decide whatdiet and treatment was best for each. Thewinged contraband had taken Nelly at her word,and flown away on the journey home. LittleRob was put in a large cage, where he could usehis legs, yet not injure his lame wing. Forked-tonguelay under a wire cover, on sprigs of fennel,for the gardener said that snakes were fond of it.The Babes in the Wood were put to bed in oneof the rush baskets, under a cotton-wool coverlet.Greenback, the beetle, found ease for his unknownaches in the warm heart of a rose, where he sunnedhimself all day. The Commodore wasmade happy in a tub of water, grass, and stones,and Mr. Fuzz was put in a well-ventilated glassbox to decide whether he would be a cocoon or not.Tony had not been idle while his mistress wasaway, and he showed her the hospital garden hehad made close by, in which were cabbage, nettle,and mignonette plants for the butterflies, floweringherbs for the bees, chick-weed and hemp forthe birds, catnip for the pussies, and plenty of roomleft for whatever other patients might need. Inthe afternoon, while Nelly did her task at lint-picking,talking busily to Will as she worked, andinteresting him in her affairs, Tony cleared apretty spot in the grove for the burying-ground,and made ready some small bits of slate on whichto write the names of those who died. He didnot have it ready an hour too soon, for at sunsettwo little graves were needed, and Nurse Nellyshed tender tears for her first losses as she laid themotherless mice in one smooth hollow, and thegray-coated rebel in the other. She had learnedto care for him already, and when she found himdead, was very glad she had been kind to him,hoping that he knew it, and died happier in herhospital than all alone in the shadowy wood.The rest of Nelly's patients prospered, and ofthe many added afterward few died, because ofTony's skilful treatment and her own faithful care.Every morning when the day proved fair the littleambulance went out upon its charitable errand;every afternoon Nelly worked for the humansufferers whom she loved; and every evening brotherWill read aloud to her from useful books, showedher wonders with his microscope, or prescribedremedies for the patients, whom he soon knew byname and took much interest in. It was Nelly'sholiday; but, though she studied no lessons, shelearned much, and unconsciously made her prettyplay both an example and a rebuke for others.At first it seemed a childish pastime, and peoplelaughed. But there was something in the familiarwords   and that made them pleasant sounds tomany ears. As reports of Nelly's work wentthrough the neighborhood, other children came tosee and copy her design. Rough lads lookedashamed when in her wards they found harmlesscreatures hurt by them, and going out they saidamong themselves,  And mostof the lads kept their word so well that peoplesaid there never had been so many birds beforeas all that summer haunted wood and field. Tender-hearted playmates brought their pets to becured; even busy farmers bad a friendly wordfor the small charity, which reminded them sosweetly of the great one which should never beforgotten; lonely mothers sometimes looked outwith wet eyes as the little ambulance went by,recalling thoughts or absent sons who might bejourneying painfully to some far-off hospital, wherebrave women waited to tend them with hands aswilling, hearts as tender, as those the gentle childgave to her self-appointed task.At home the charm worked also. No more idledays for Nelly, or fretful ones for Will, becausethe little sister would not neglect the helplesscreatures so dependent upon her, and the bigbrother was ashamed to complain after watchingthe patience of these lesser sufferers, and merrilysaid he would try to bear his own wound asquietly and bravely as the  borehis. Nelly never knew how much good she haddone Captain Will till he went away again in theearly autumn. Then he thanked her for it, andthough she cried for joy and sorrow she neverforgot it, because he left something behind himwhich always pleasantly reminded her of thedouble success her little hospital had won.When Will was gone and she had prayedsoftly in her heart that God would keep him safeand bring him home again, she dried her tearsand went away to find comfort in the place wherehe had spent so many happy hours with her. Shehad not been there before that day, and when shereached the door she stood quite still and wantedvery much to cry again, far something beautifulhad happened. She had often asked Will for amotto for her hospital, and he had promised tofind her one. She thought he had forgotten it;but even in the hurry of that busy day he hadfound time to do more than keep his word, whileNelly sat indoors, lovingly brightening the tarnishedbuttons on the blue coat that had seen somany battles.Above the roof, where the doves cooed in thesun, now rustled a white flag with the goldenS.C.He prayeth best who loveth bestAll things, both great and small;For the dear God who loveth us,He made and loveth all.'
