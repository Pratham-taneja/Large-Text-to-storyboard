ROSES It was a cold November storm, and everything looked forlorn. Eventhe pert sparrows were draggle-tailed and too much out of spirits tofight for crumbs with the fat pigeons who tripped through the mudwith their little red boots as if in haste to get back to their cosyhome in the dove-cot.But the most forlorn creature out that day was a small errand girl,with a bonnet-box on each arm, and both hands struggling to hold abig broken umbrella. A pair of worn-out boots let in the wet uponher tired feet; a thin cotton dress and an old shawl poorlyprotected her from the storm; and a faded hood covered her head.The face that looked out from this hood was too pale and anxious forone so young; and when a sudden gust turned the old umbrella insideout with a crash, despair fell upon poor Lizzie, and she was somiserable she could have sat down in the rain and cried.But there was no time for tears; so, dragging the dilapidatedumbrella along, she spread her shawl over the bonnet-boxes andhurried down the broad street, eager to hide her misfortunes from apretty young girl who stood at a window laughing at her.She could not find the number of the house where one of the finehats was to be left; and after hunting all down one side of thestreet, she crossed over, and came at last to the very house wherethe pretty girl lived. She was no longer to be seen; and, with asigh of relief, Lizzie rang the bell, and was told to wait in thehall while Miss Belle tried the hat on.Glad to rest, she warmed her feet, righted her umbrella, and thensat looking about her with eyes quick to see the beauty and thecomfort that made the place so homelike and delightful. A smallwaiting-room opened from the hall, and in it stood many bloomingplants, whose fragrance attracted Lizzie as irresistibly as if shehad been a butterfly or bee.Slipping in, she stood enjoying the lovely colors, sweet odors, anddelicate shapes of these household spirits; for Lizzie loved flowerspassionately; and just then they possessed a peculiar charm for her.One particularly captivating little rose won her heart, and made herlong for it with a longing that became a temptation too strong toresist. It was so perfect; so like a rosy face smiling out from thegreen leaves, that Lizzie could NOT keep her hands off it, andhaving smelt, touched, and kissed it, she suddenly broke the stemand hid it in her pocket. Then, frightened at what she had done, shecrept back to her place in the hall, and sat there, burdened withremorse.A servant came just then to lead her upstairs; for Miss Belle wishedthe hat altered, and must give directions. With her heart in aflutter, and pinker roses in her cheeks than the one in her pocket,Lizzie followed to a handsome room, where a pretty girl stood beforea long mirror with the hat in her hand. said the young lady, in a dissatisfied tone, as shetwirled the hat about. was all Lizzie could say; for SHE considered that hatthe loveliest thing a girl could possibly own.put in a maid, who was sewing in the ante-room. answered Belle, crossly.Then she glanced at Lizzie, and said more gently, said Lizzie, gratefully, but timidly.said Lizzie, smiling brightly at the thought of the welcome gift. beganBelle, who found something rather interesting in the shabby girl,with shy bright eyes, and curly hair bursting out of the old hood. said Lizzie, with a pathetic glance ather poor clothes. asked Belle, hopingto find something pleasant to talk about; for she was a kind littlesoul. cried Belle,looking quite distressed. And the forlorn look came back to poor Lizzie's face.Belle said nothing, but sat among the sofa cushions, where she hadthrown herself, looking soberly at this other girl, no older thanshe was, who took care of herself and was all alone in the world. Itwas a new idea to Belle, who was loved and petted as an only childis apt to be. She often saw beggars and pitied them, but knew verylittle about their wants and lives; so it was like turning a newpage in her happy life to be brought so near to poverty as thischance meeting with the milliner's girl. she said, slowly,trying to understand and put herself in Lizzie's place. answered Lizzie, morehopefully, because Belle's pity warmed her heart and made hertroubles seem lighter. asked Belle, hoping mamma wouldn't come justyet, for she was getting interested in the stranger.There Lizzie stopped suddenly, and the color rushed up to herforehead; for she remembered the little rose in her pocket and itweighed upon her conscience like a stone.Before Belle could ask what was the matter, Marie came in with atray of cake and fruit, saying:And Belle shook her head as she glanced at Lizzie, who was staringhard at the fire with such a troubled face that Belle could not bearto see it.Jumping out of her nest of cushions, she heaped a plate with goodthings, and going to Lizzie, offered it, saying, with a gentlecourtesy that made the act doubly sweet:But Lizzie could not take it; she could only cover her face and cry;for this kindness rent her heart and made the stolen flower a burdentoo heavy to be borne. said Belle, surprisedand troubled. sobbed Lizzie, quite overcome with penitence; and taking outthe crumpled rose, she confessed her fault with many tears. began Belle,warmly; then checked herself, and added, more soberly, Lizzie had poured out her trouble rapidly; and the little story wasquite affecting when one saw the tears on her cheeks, the poorclothes, and the thin hands that held the stolen rose. Belle wasmuch touched, and, in her impetuous way, set about mending mattersas fast as possible.With a nod and a smile, Belle flew about the room a minute; thenvanished, leaving Lizzie to her comfortable task, feeling as iffairies still haunted the world as in the good old times.When Belle came back with a handful of roses, she found Lizzieabsorbed in admiring contemplation of her new boots, as she atesponge-cake in a blissful sort of waking-dream. And she offered the nosegay with a much happier face thanthe one Lizzie first saw.  answered Lizzie, smiling allover her face as she buried her nose luxuriously in the fragrantmass.With kind words like these, Belle dismissed Lizzie, who randownstairs, feeling as rich as if she had found a fortune. Away tothe next place she hurried, anxious to get her errands done and theprecious posy safely into fresh water. But Mrs. Turretviile was notat home, and the bonnet could not be left till paid for. So Lizzieturned to go down the high steps, glad that she need not wait. Shestopped one instant to take a delicious sniff at her flowers, andthat was the last happy moment that poor Lizzie knew for many wearymonths.The new boots were large for her, the steps slippery with sleet, anddown went the little errand girl, from top to bottom, till shelanded in the gutter directly upon Mrs. Turretville's costly bonnet. sighed Lizzie, as she picked herselfup, bruised, wet, and faint with pain;  groaned thepoor child, sitting on the curbstone to get her breath and view thedisaster.The rain poured, the wind blew, the sparrows on the park railingchirped derisively, and no one came along to help Lizzie out of hertroubles. Slowly she gathered up her burdens; painfully she limpedaway in the big boots; and the last the naughty sparrows saw of herwas a shabby little figure going round the corner, with a pale,tearful face held lovingly over the bright bouquet that was her onetreasure and her only comfort in the moment which brought to her thegreat misfortune of her life.  IIFORGET-ME-NOTS criedpretty Belle, five years later, on the morning before her eighteenthbirthday.said Belle, dancing about the great trunk, as the maid carefullyunfolded tissue papers and muslin wrappers.A young girl's first ball-dress is a grand affair,--in her eyes, atleast; and Belle soon stopped dancing, to stand with clasped hands,eager eyes and parted lips before the snowy pile of illusion thatwas at last daintily lifted out upon the bed. Then, as Mariedisplayed its loveliness, little cries of delight were heard, andwhen the whole delicate dress was arranged to the best effect shethrew herself upon her mother's neck and actually cried withpleasure.Mamma got no further, for Marie uttered a French shriek, wrung herhands, and then began to burrow wildly in the trunk and among thepapers, crying distractedly:In vain they searched; in vain Marie wailed and Belle declared itmust be somewhere; no wreath appeared. It was duly set down in thebill, and a fine sum charged for a head-dress to match the daintyforget-me-nots that looped the fleecy skirts and ornamented thebosom of the dress. It had evidently been forgotten; and mammadespatched Marie at once to try and match the flowers, for Bellewould not hear of any other decoration for her beautiful blondehair.The dress fitted to a charm, and was pronounced by all beholders theloveliest thing ever seen. Nothing was wanted but the wreath to makeit quite perfect, and when Marie returned, after a long search, withno forget-me-nots, Belle was in despair. suggested a sympathizing friend.But another hunt among greenhouses was as fruitless as that amongthe milliners' rooms. No forget-me-nots could be found, and Mariefell exhausted into a chair, desolated at what she felt to be anawful calamity. cried Belle, growing more resolute with each failure.Marnma was deep in preparations for the ball, and could not help herafflicted daughter, though she was much disappointed at the mishap.So Belle drove off, resolved to have her flowers whether there wereany or not.Any one who has ever tried to match a ribbon, find a certain fabric,or get anything done in a hurry, knows what a wearisome task itsometimes is, and can imagine Belle's state of mind after repeateddisappointments. She was about to give up in despair, when some onesuggested that perhaps the Frenchwoman, Estelle Valnor, might makethe desired wreath, if there was time.Away drove Belle, and, on entering the room, gave a sigh ofsatisfaction, for a whole boxful of the loveliest forget-me-notsstood upon the table. As fast as possible, she told her tale anddemanded the flowers, no matter what the price might be. Imagine herfeelings when the Frenchwoman, with a shrug, announced that it wasimpossible to give mademoiselle a single spray. All were engaged totrim a bridesmaid's dress, and must be sent away at once.It really was too bad! and Belle lost her temper entirely, for nopersuasion or bribes would win a spray from Estelle. The provokingpart of it was that the wedding would not come off for several days,and there was time enough to make more flowers for that dress, sinceBelle only wanted a few for her hair. Neither would Estelle make herany, as her hands were full, and so small an order was not worthderanging one's self for; but observing Belle's sorrowful face, shesaid, affably:Belle took the card with thanks, and hurried away with a last hopefaintly stirring in her girlish heart, for Belle had an unusuallyardent wish to look her best at this party, since Somebody was to bethere, and Somebody considered forget-me-nots the sweetest flowersin the world. Mamma knew this, and the kiss Belle gave her when thedress came had a more tender meaning than gratified vanity ordaughterly love.Up many stairs she climbed, and came at last to a little room, verypoor but very neat, where, at the one window, sat a young girl, withcrutches by her side and her lap full of flower-leaves and petals.She rose slowly as Belle came in, and then stood looking at her,with such a wistful expression in her shy, bright eyes, that Belle'sanxious face cleared involuntarily, and her voice lost its impatienttone.As she spoke, she glanced about the room, hoping to see some blueblossoms awaiting her. But none appeared; and she was about todespond again, when the girl said, gently:Miss Berton glanced at it, then cast a quick look at the sweet,anxious face before her, and smiled so brightly that Belle smiledalso, and asked, wonderingly:But Belle still shook her head and watched the smiling face beforeher with wondering eyes, till the girl added, with sudden color inher cheeks: began Belle, who did faintly recollectthat little incident in her happy life.And Lizzie went on to tell how Madame had dismissed her in a rage;how she lay ill till Mrs. Brown sent her to the hospital; and howfor a year she had suffered much alone, in that great house of pain,before one of the kind visitors had befriended her.While hearing the story of the five years, that had been so full ofpleasure, ease and love for herself, Belle forgot her errand, and,sitting beside Lizzie, listened with pitying eyes to all she told ofher endeavors to support herself by the delicate handiwork sheloved. ended Lizzie, looking about the little bareroom with a face full of the sweetest content. A little sigh followed the words, and Belle put her own plump handon the delicate one that held the crutch, saying, in her cordialyoung voice:Lizzie thanked her with a look, and then said, in a tone of interestthat was delightful to hear:Belle had forgotten all about it in listening to this sad littlestory of a girl's life. Now she felt half ashamed to talk of sofrivolous a matter till she remembered that it would help Lizzie;and, resolving to pay for it as never garland was paid for before,she entered upon the subject with renewed interest. said Lizzie, beginning to lay outmysterious little tools and bend delicate wires.Pretty Belle looked prettier than ever as she listened, and a brighttear stood in either eye like a drop of dew on a blue flower. Ittouched her very much to learn that her little act of childishcharity had been so sweet and helpful to this lonely girl, and nowlived so freshly in her grateful memory. It showed her, suddenly,how precious little deeds of love and sympathy are; how strong tobless, how easy to perform, how comfortable to recall. Her heart wasvery full and tender just then, and the lesson sunk deep into itnever to be forgotten.She sat a long time watching flowers bud and blossom under Lizzie'sskilful fingers, and then hurried home to tell all her glad news tomamma.If the next day had not been full of most delightfully excitingevents, Belle might have felt some anxiety about her wreath, forhour after hour went by and nothing arrived from Lizzie.Evening came, and all was ready. Belle was dressed, and looked solovely that mamma declared she needed nothing more. But Marieinsisted that the grand effect would be ruined without the garlandamong the sunshiny hair. Belle had time now to be anxious, andwaited with growing impatience for the finishing touch to hercharming toilette. she said at last, with a sighof disappointment, for the desire to look beautiful that night inSomebody's eyes had increased four-fold.With a tragic gesture, Marie was about to adjust the pompon when thequick tap of a crutch came down the hall, and Lizzie hurried in,flushed and breathless, but smiling happily as she uncovered the boxshe carried with a look of proud satisfaction.A general  of admiration arose as Belle, mamma, and Mariesurveyed the lovely wreath that lay before them; and when it wascarefully arranged on the bright head that was to wear it, Belleblushed with pleasure. Mamma said:  and Marie clasped her hands theatrically,sighing, with her head on one side: said Lizzie, refreshing her wearyeyes with a long, affectionate gaze at the pretty figure before her.A fold of the airy skirt was caught on one of the blue clusters, andLizzie knelt down to arrange it as she spoke. Belle leaned towardher and said softly:  whispered Lizzie, kissing thekind hand held out to help her rise, for on it she saw a brilliantring, and in the blooming, blushing face bent over her she read thetender little story that Somebody had told Belle that day. answered Belle, as her full heart bubbled over with pityingaffection for the poor girl who would never make a bridal garlandfor herself.Belle kept her word, even when she was in a happy home of her own;for out of the dead roses bloomed a friendship that brightenedLizzie's life; and long after the blue garland was faded Belleremembered the helpful little lesson that taught her to read thefaces poverty touches with a pathetic eloquence, which says to thosewho look,                      Add  Roses and Forget-Me-Nots to your library.
