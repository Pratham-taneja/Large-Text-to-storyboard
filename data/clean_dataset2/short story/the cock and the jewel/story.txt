A Cock was busily scratching and scraping about to find something to eat for himself and his family, when he happened to turn up a precious jewel that had been lost by its owner.\n\n\t said the Cock. 'No doubt you are very costly and he who lost you would give a great deal to find you. But as for me, I would choose a single grain of barleycorn before all the jewels in the world.'\n\n\tPrecious things are without value to those who cannot prize them.\n\n\t               Add  The Cock And The Jewel to your library.
