Some Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth. A Fox chanced to see them and laughed scornfully.\n\n\t he said, 'it would have been a very different story. He would have made you feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth.'\n\n\tIt is easy and also contemptible to kick a man that is down.\n\n\t               Add  The Dogs And The Fox to your library.
