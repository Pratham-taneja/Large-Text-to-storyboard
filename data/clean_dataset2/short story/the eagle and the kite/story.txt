An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak. She seemed very sad and drooping for an Eagle. A Kite saw her.\n\n\t asked the Kite.\n\n\t replied the Eagle, 'and I can't find a mate who can provide for me as I should like.Take me,I am very strong, stronger even than you!Do you really think you can provide for me?' asked the Eagle eagerly.\n\n\t replied the Kite. 'That would be a very simple matter. I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather!'\n\n\tThe Eagle accepted the Kite immediately. But after the wedding, when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride, all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.\n\n\t said the Eagle in disgust.\n\n\t replied the Kite.\n\n\tEverything is fair in love.\n\n\t               Add  The Eagle And The Kite to your library.
