Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir-tree. The place he had was a very good one; the sun shone on him; as to fresh air, there was enough of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.\n\n\tHe did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries. The children often came with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said,  But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.\n\n\tAt the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year he was another long bit taller; for with fir-trees one can always tell by the shoots how many years old they are.\n\n\t sighed he. \n\n\tNeither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds, which morning and evening sailed above them, gave the little Tree any pleasure.\n\n\tIn winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would often come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that made him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it.  thought the Tree—\n\n\tIn autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees. This happened every year; and the young Fir-tree, that had now grown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be recognized; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged them out of the woods.\n\n\tWhere did they go to? What became of them?\n\n\tIn spring, when the Swallows and the Storks came, the Tree asked them, \n\n\tThe Swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked musing, nodded his head, and said: \n\n\t\n\n\t said the Stork, and with these words off he went.\n\n\t said the Sunbeams, \n\n\tAnd the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the Fir understood it not.\n\n\tWhen Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down; trees which often were not even as large or of the same age as this Fir-tree, who could never rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they were always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid on carts, and the horses drew them out of the woods.\n\n\t asked the Fir. \n\n\t chirped the Sparrows. \n\n\t asked the Fir-tree, trembling in every bough. \n\n\t\n\n\t cried the Tree, rejoicing. \n\n\t said the Air and the Sunlight; \n\n\tBut the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green both winter and summer. People that saw him said,  and toward Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe struck deep into the very pith; the tree fell to the earth with a sigh: he felt a pang—it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness, for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place where he had sprung up. He knew well that he should never see his dear old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, any more; perhaps not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.\n\n\tThe Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees, and heard a man say,  Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the Fir-tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging on the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese vases with lions on the covers. There, too, were large easy chairs, silken sofas, large tables full of picture-books, and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns—at least the children said so. And the Fir-tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand: but no one could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all around it, and it stood on a large gayly coloured carpet. Oh, how the Tree quivered! What was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, and each net was filled with sugar-plums; and among the other boughs gilded apples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown there, and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves. Dolls that looked for all the world like men—the Tree had never beheld such before—were seen among the foliage, and at the very top a large star of gold tinsel was fixed. It was really splendid—beyond description splendid.\n\n\t said they all; \n\n\t thought the Tree, \n\n\tHe knew very much about the matter! but he was so impatient that for sheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same thing as a headache with us.\n\n\tThe candles were now lighted. What brightness! What splendour! The Tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the foliage. It blazed up splendidly.\n\n\t cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.\n\n\tNow the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendour, that he was quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both folding-doors opened, and a troop of children rushed in as if they would upset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones stood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted so that the whole place reechoed with their rejoicing; they danced round the tree, and one present after the other was pulled off.\n\n\t thought the Tree.  And the lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down they were put out, one after the other, and then the children had permission to plunder the tree. So they fell upon it with such violence that all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the cask, it would certainly have tumbled down.\n\n\tThe children danced about with their beautiful playthings: no one looked at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been forgotten.\n\n\t cried the children, drawing a little fat man toward the tree. He seated himself under it, and said: \n\n\t cried some;  cried the others. There was such a bawling and screaming—the Fir-tree alone was silent, and he thought to himself,  for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to do.\n\n\tAnd the man told about Klumpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who notwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess. And the children clapped their hands, and cried out,  They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy, too, but the little man only told them about Klumpy-Dumpy. The Fir-tree stood quite still and absorbed in thought; the birds in the woods had never related the like of this.  thought the Fir-tree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good-looking.  And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked out again with lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.\n\n\t thought the Fir-tree.  And the whole night the Tree stood still and in deep thought.\n\n\tIn the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.\n\n\t thought the Fir. But they dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft; and here in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him.  thought the Tree.  And he leaned against the wall, lost in reverie. Time enough had he, too, for his reflections; for days and nights passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way. There stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely forgotten.\n\n\t thought the Tree. \n\n\t said a little Mouse at the same moment, peeping out of his hole. And then another little one came. They sniffed about the Fir-tree, and rustled among the branches.\n\n\t said the Mouse. \n\n\t said the Fir-tree. \n\n\t asked the Mice;  They were so extremely curious. \n\n\t said the Tree,  And then he told all about his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they listened and said:\n\n\t\n\n\t said the Fir-tree, thinking over what he had himself related.  And then he told about Christmas Eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.\n\n\t said the little Mice, \n\n\t said he. \n\n\t said the Mice: and the next night they came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the tree recounted; and the more he related, the more plainly he remembered all himself; and it appeared as if those times had really been happy times.  and he thought at the moment of a nice little Birch-tree growing out in the woods; to the Fir, that would be a real charming princess.\n\n\t asked the Mice. So then the Fir-tree told the whole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats, even; but they said the stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they, too, now began to think them not so very amusing either.\n\n\t asked the Rats.\n\n\t answered the Tree. \n\n\t\n\n\t said the Tree.\n\n\t said the Rats; and they went home.\n\n\tAt last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: \n\n\tBut when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the Tree was pulled out and thrown—rather hard, it is true—down on the floor, but a man drew him toward the stairs, where the daylight shone.\n\n\t thought the Tree. He felt the fresh air, the first sunbeam—and now he was out in the courtyard. All passed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, that the Tree quite forgot to look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in flower; the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the lindens were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said,  but it was not the Fir-tree that they meant.\n\n\t said he, exultingly, and spread out his branches; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow. It was in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.\n\n\tIn the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at Christmas round the Fir-tree, and were so glad at the sight of him. One of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.\n\n\t said he, trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet. And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in the garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark corner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the woods, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so much pleasure to the story of Klumpy-Dumpy.\n\n\t said the poor Tree. \n\n\tAnd the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a whole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.\n\n\tThe boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star on his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his life. However, that was over now—the Tree gone, the story at an end. All, all was over; every tale must end at last.\n\n\t               Add  The Fir-Tree to your library.
