A Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover. The Goatherd tried to call it back, but in vain. It would not obey him. Then he picked up a stone and threw it, breaking the Goat's horn.\n\n\tThe Goatherd was frightened.\n\n\t he begged the Goat.\n\n\t said the Goat, \n\n\tWicked deeds will not stay hid.\n\n\tIt's no use trying to hide what can't be hidden.
