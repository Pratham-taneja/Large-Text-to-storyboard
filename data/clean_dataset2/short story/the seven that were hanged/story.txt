I\n\n\t'AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON, YOUR EXCELLENCY!Pardon me,How do they know that I am to go to present my report at one o'clock in the afternoon, when I learned it myself only two days ago?At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!Brave fellows! Brave fellows!At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!one o'clock in the afternoonAh!Imbeciles!Imbeciles!brave fellows,Evidently,I am afraid now because I have been warned and because I know. But, if I had been left in ignorance, I should have taken my coffee quietly. And then, evidently, this death. . . . But am I then so afraid of death? I have a kidney trouble; some day I must die of it, and yet I am not afraid, because I don't know when. And these imbeciles say to me: 'At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!' They thought that I would be glad to know about it! . . . Instead of that, death has placed himself in the corner yonder, and does not go away! He does not go away, because I have that fixed idea! To die is not so terrible; the terrible thing is to know that one is going to die. It would be quite impossible for a man to live if he knew the hour and day of his death with absolute certainty. And yet these idiots warn me: 'At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!'At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!It's nothing.It's nothing, Vasya. It will soon be over!The dear comrade, he is looking at the sky. Look, look!And Vasya? My God! My God! . . . What can be done to comfort him? If I speak to him, perhaps it will make matters worse; suppose he should begin to weep?It's nothing, Vasya! All will soon be over!But there is nothing the matter with me, brother!The devil take them! They have hanged us all just the same!It was to have been expected,To-morrow the final judgment will be rendered, and they will put us all in the same cell,We shall remain together until the execution.I MUST NOT BE HANGEDIt would kill me myself!You are only an imbecile, Ivan!She has said that I must be hanged.'She'? Who?You!Well?She has said that I must be hanged. I must not be hanged.Take away the accused.I must not be hanged.Well, you are a famous imbecile, you are!I must not be hanged!Well, brother, there you are, hanged!And when will they bang me?Ah! wait, brother; you must have companions; they do not disturb themselves for a single individual, and especially for a little fellow like you.Then, when?When? When?It is not a question of hanging a dog, which one takes behind a shed and dispatches with a single blow! Is that what you would like, imbecile?Why, no, I would not like it!'Twas she that said I must be hanged, but I, I do not want to be hanged!The devil take you!Why do you show your teeth? This is no wine-shop!And I, I do not want to be hanged! Ha! ha! ha!Satan!I must not be hanged,You have time enough.She would love me now,Now I am as big as her husband.It will be soon. In a week, I think.You are joking?Formerly you could not await the time, to-day you say that I am joking. No jokes are tolerated here. It is you who like jokes, but we do not tolerate them,Ah!Do you want to see someone?Why?To say good-bye, of course . . . to your mother, for instance, or to your brother.I must not be hanged,I do not want to be hanged.He is stunned; now he will feel nothing more until the moment of death,Ivan, do you hear? Ho there, Ivan!I must not be hanged!If you had not killed, they would not hang you,To steal, you have killed, and you do not want to be hanged!I do not want to be hanged!Well, you don't have to want to; that's your affair. But, instead of talking nonsense, you would do better to dispose of your possessions. You surely must have something.He has nothing at all! A shirt and a pair of pantaloons! And a fur cap!Get ready! it is time to start.How warm it is to-day! It is spring!Come, come! Make haste!

It is very interesting.What a brigand!It was really interesting.It is just!Well, let us be off, imbecile! And keep a good hold of your gun, lest I snatch it from you!See how he has dirtied his cell!And you, you ugly mug, you have soiled the whole earth, and I haven't said a word to you. Why do you annoy me?So they can find none! That's not bad! Go on then hanging people! Ah! Ah! There are necks and ropes, and nobody to do the hanging! My God, that's not bad.They will give your life as a reward!I should say so: I could hardly play the hangman after I am dead!Well, what do you say, yes or no?And how do they hang here? They probably choke people secretly.No, they hang them to music!Imbecile! Of course there must be music . . . like this. . . .You have gone completely mad, my friend!Come, speak seriously, what is your decision?Are you in a hurry? Come back later, and I will tell you!What a hurry you are in! Come back another time!You have lost your chance, my ill-favoured raven. They have found another.The devil take you!

Do not speak immediately after kissing him, do you understand? Otherwise you will say what you should not.I understand, Nicolas Sergiévitch!And do not weep! May God keep you from that! Do not weep! You will kill him if you weep, mother!And why do you weep yourself?Why should one not weep here with the rest of you?

You will soon have another on your finger!No, no, it is useless!In fact,I am young; I might have lived for a long time. But . . .Is it possible?Is it possible that I am worth anybody's tears?One should not play with death!Is this really death? My God, how beautiful it is! Or is it life? I do not know, I do not know! I am going to see and hear. . . .Again!word of honor.Either you are all asses, or else I am an ass!It is you who are an ass. You show it in your voice!Why don't you eat? Eat; it is necessary to get strength!I am not hungry.Well, I will eat your bread! Shall I?What an appetite you have, Sergey!A hostile wind is blowing o'er our heads.' After the arrest Sergey had a moment of sadness; the plot had been badly planned. But he said to himself:  And his gaiety returned. On his second day in the fortress he began gymnastic exercises, according to the extremely rational system of a German named Müller, which interested him much. He undressed himself completely; and, to the amazement of the anxious sentinel, he went carefully through the eighteen prescribed exercises.\n\n\tAs a propagander of the Müller system, it gave him much satisfaction to see the soldier follow his movements. Although he knew that he would get no answer, he said to the eye that appeared at the grating:\n\n\t he added, in a gentle and persuasive voice, that he might not frighten the soldier, not suspecting that his guardian took him for a madman.\n\n\tThe fear of death showed itself in him progressively, seemingly by shocks: it seemed to him that someone was thumping him violently in the heart from below. Then the sensation disappeared, but came back a few hours later, each time more intense and prolonged. It was beginning already to take on the vague outlines of an unendurable anguish.\n\n\t thought Sergey, in astonishment. \n\n\tIt was not he who was afraid; it was his young, robust, and vigorous body, which neither the gymnastics of Müller nor the cold shower-baths could deceive. The stronger and fresher he became after his cold-water ablutions, the more acute and unendurable was his sensation of temporary fear. And it was in the morning, after his deep sleep and physical exercises, that this atrocious fear like something foreign appeared—exactly at the moment when formerly he had been particularly conscious of his strength and his joy in living. He noticed this, and said to himself:\n\n\t\n\n\tFrom that time he gave up his gymnastics and his massage. And, to explain this right-about-face, he cried to the soldier:\n\n\t\n\n\tIn fact, he felt a sort of relief. He tried also to eat less in order to further weaken himself, but, in spite of the lack of air and exercise, his appetite remained excellent. Sergey could not resist it, and ate everything that they brought him. Then he resorted to a subterfuge; before sitting down to table, he poured half of his soup into his bucket. And this method succeeded; a great weariness, a vague numbness, took possession of him.\n\n\t he said, threatening his body; and he caressed his softening muscles sadly.\n\n\tBut soon the body became accustomed to this régime and the fear of death appeared again, not in so acute a form, but as a vague sensation of nausea, still harder to bear.  thought Sergey.  He tried to sleep as much as possible. His first efforts were not altogether fruitless; then insomnia set in, accompanied with obsessing thoughts and, with these, a regret that he must part with life.\n\n\t he asked himself, thinking of death. \n\n\tWhen he clearly understood that for him all was over, that he had before him only a few hours of empty waiting and then death, he had a queer feeling. It seemed to him that they had stripped him naked in an extraordinary fashion. Not only had they taken away his clothes, but also sun, air, sound and light, speech and the power of action. Death had not yet arrived, and yet life seemed already absent; he felt a strange sensation, sometimes incomprehensible, sometimes intelligible, but very subtle and mysterious.\n\n\t wondered Sergey, in his torment. \n\n\tHe examined himself attentively, with interest, beginning with his loose slippers, such as the prisoners wore, and stopping with his belly, over which hung his ample cloak. He began to walk back and forth in his cell, with arms apart, and continued to look at himself as a woman does when trying on a gown that is too long. He tried to turn his head: is turned. And what seemed to him a little terrifying was he himself, Sergey Golovin, who soon would be no more!\n\n\tEverything become strange.\n\n\tHe tried to walk, and it seemed queer to him to walk. He tried to sit down, and he was surprised that he could do so. He tried to drink water, and it seemed queer to him to drink, to swallow, to hold the goblet, to see his fingers, his trembling fingers. He began to cough, and thought: \n\n\t he asked himself. \n\n\tHe wiped his brow, and this gesture seemed to him equally surprising. Then he fixed himself in a motionless posture, without breathing—for entire hours, it seemed to him, extinguishing all thought, holding his breath, avoiding all motion; for every thought was madness, every gesture an aberration. Time disappeared as if transformed into space, into a transparent space in which there was no air, into an immense place containing everything—land and life and men. And one could take in everything at a glance, to the very extremity, to the edge of the unknown gulf, to death. And it was not because he saw death that Sergey suffered, but because he saw life and death at the same time. A sacrilegious hand had lifted the curtain which from all eternity had hidden the mystery of life and the mystery of death; they had ceased to be mysteries, but they were no more comprehensible than truth written in a foreign language.\n\n\t he suddenly declared aloud, in a voice of deep conviction. He shook his head and began to laugh gaily, sincerely:\n\n\t\n\n\tHe quickly made the round of his cell; and, to the great astonishment of the soldier who was watching him through the grating, he entirely undressed and went through the eighteen exercises with scrupulous exactness. He bent and straightened up his young body which had grown a little thin; he stooped, inhaling and exhaling the air; he raised himself on tiptoe, and moved his arms and legs.\n\n\t reasoned Sergey, throwing out his chest, his ribs outlining themselves plainly under his thin, distended skin—\n\n\tHe leaned on his right side, and repeated:\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tIX\n\n\tTHE HORRIBLE SOLITUDE\n\n\tUnder the same roof and to the same melodious chant of the indifferent hours, separated from Sergey and from Musya by a few empty cells, but as isolated as if he alone had existed in the whole universe, the unhappy Vasily Kashirin was finishing his life in anguish and terror.\n\n\tCovered with sweat, his shirt adhering to his body, his formerly curly hair now falling in straight locks, he went back and forth in his cell with the jerky and lamentable gait of one suffering atrociously with the toothache. He sat down for a moment, and then began to run again; then he rested his forehead against the wall, stopped, and looked about as if in search of a remedy. He had so changed that one might think that he possessed two different faces, one of which, the younger, had gone nobody knows where, to give place to the second, a terrible face, that seemed to have come from darkness.\n\n\tFear had shown itself suddenly to him, and had seized upon his person as an exclusive and sovereign mistress. On the fatal morning, when he was marching to certain death, he had played with it; but that evening, confined in his cell, he had been carried away and lashed by a wave of mad terror. As long as he had gone freely forward to meet danger and death, as long as he had held his fate in his own hands, however terrible it might be, he had appeared tranquil and even joyous, the small amount of shameful and decrepit fear that he had felt having disappeared in a consciousness of infinite liberty, in the firm and audacious affirmation of his intrepid will, leaving no trace behind. With an infernal machine strapped around his waist, he had transformed himself into an instrument of death, he had borrowed from the dynamite its cruel reason and its flashing and homicidal power. In the street, among the busy people preoccupied with their affairs and quickly dodging the tramcars and the cabs, it seemed to him as if he came from another and an unknown world, where there was no such thing as death or fear.\n\n\tSuddenly a brutal, bewildering change had taken place. Vasily no longer went where he wanted to go, but was led where others wanted him to go. He no longer chose his place; they placed him in a stone cage and locked him in, as if he were a thing. He could no longer choose between life and death; they led him to death, certainly and inevitably. He who had been for a moment the incarnation of will, of life, and of force, had become a lamentable specimen of impotence; he was nothing but an animal destined for the slaughter. Whatever he might say, they would not listen; if he started to cry out, they would stuff a rag in his mouth; and, if he even tried to walk, they would take him away and hang him. If he resisted, if he struggled, if he lay down on the ground, they would be stronger than he; they would pick him up, they would tie him, and thus they would carry him to the gallows. And his imagination gave to the men charged with this execution, men like himself, the new, extraordinary, and terrifying aspect of unthinking automata, whom nothing in the world could stop, and who seized a man, overpowered him, hanged him, pulled him by the feet, cut the rope, put the body in a coffin, carried it away, and buried it.\n\n\tFrom the first day of his imprisonment, people and life had transformed themselves for him into an unspeakably frightful world filled with mechanical dolls. Almost mad with fear, he tried to fancy to himself that these people had tongues and spoke, but he did not succeed. Their mouths opened, something like a sound came from them; then they separated with movements of their legs, and all was over. He was in the situation of a man who, left alone in a house at night, should see all things become animate, move, and assume over him an unlimited power; suddenly the wardrobe, the chair, the sofa, the writing-table would sit in judgment upon him. He would cry out, call for help, beg, and rove from room to room; and the things would speak to each other in their own tongue; and then the wardrobe, the chair, the sofa, and the writing-table would start to hang him, the other things looking on.\n\n\tIn the eyes of Vasily Kashirin, sentenced to be hanged, everything took on a puerile aspect; the cell, the grated door, the striking apparatus of the clock, the fortress with its carefully modelled ceilings, and, above, the mechanical doll equipped with a musket, who walked up and down in the corridor, and the other dolls who frightened him by looking through the grating and handing him his food without a word.\n\n\tA man had disappeared from the world.\n\n\tIn court the presence of the comrades had brought Kashirin back to himself. Again for a moment he saw people; they were there, judging him, speaking the language of men, listening, and seeming to understand. But, when he saw his mother, he felt clearly, with the terror of a man who is going mad and he knows it, that this old woman in a black neckerchief was a simple mechanical doll. He was astonished at not having suspected it before, and at having awaited this visit as something infinitely sorrowful in its distressing gentleness. While forcing himself to speak, he thought with a shudder:\n\n\t\n\n\tWhen the mother began to weep, Vasily again saw something human in her, but this disappeared with the first words that she uttered. With curiosity and terror he watched the tears flow from the doll's eyes.\n\n\tWhen his fear became intolerable, Vasily Kashirin tried to pray. There remained with him only a bitter, detestable, and enervating rancor against all the religious principles upon which his youth had been nourished, in the house of his father, a large merchant. He had no faith. But one day, in his childhood, he had heard some words that had made an impression upon him and that remained surrounded forever with a gentle poesy. These words were:\n\n\t\n\n\tSometimes, in painful moments, he whispered, without praying, without even accounting to himself for what he was doing:  And then he suddenly felt relieved; he had a desire to approach someone who was dear to him and complain gently:\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd then suddenly he felt himself ridiculous; he would have liked to bare his breast and ask someone to beat it.\n\n\tHe had spoken to no one, not even to his best comrades, of his  He seemed to know nothing of it himself, so deeply hidden was it in his soul. And he evoked it rarely, with precaution.\n\n\tNow that the fear of the unfathomable mystery which was rising before him completely covered him, as the water covers the plants on the bank when the tide is rising, he had a desire to pray. He wanted to fall upon his knees, but was seized with shame before the sentinel; so, with hands clasped upon his breast, he murmured in a low voice:\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd he repeated with anxiety, in a tone of supplication:\n\n\t\n\n\tSomething moved softly. It seemed to him that a sorrowful and gentle force hovered in the distance and then vanished, without illuminating the shades of the agony. In the steeple the hour struck. The soldier yawned long and repeatedly.\n\n\t\n\n\tHe wore an imploring smile, and waited. But in his soul there was the same void as around him. Useless and tormenting thoughts came to him; again he saw the lighted candles, the priest in his robe, the holy image painted on the wall, his father bending and straightening up again, praying and kneeling, casting furtive glances at Vasily to see if he too was praying or was simply amusing himself. And Kashirin was in still deeper anguish than before.\n\n\tEverything disappeared.\n\n\tHis consciousness went out like the dying embers that one scatters on the hearth; it froze, like the body of a man just dead in which the heart is still warm while the hands and feet are already cold.\n\n\tVasily had a moment of wild terror when they came into his cell to get him. He did not even suspect that the hour of the execution had arrived; he simply saw the people and took fright, almost like a child.\n\n\t he whispered, without being heard; and his lips became icy as he recoiled slowly toward the rear of his cell, just as in childhood he had tried to escape the punishments of his father.\n\n\t\n\n\tThey talked, they walked around him, they gave him he knew not what. He closed his eyes, staggered, and began to prepare himself painfully. Undoubtedly he had recovered consciousness; he suddenly asked a cigarette of one of the officials, who amiably extended his cigarette case.\n\n\t\n\n\tX\n\n\tTHE WALLS CRUMBLE\n\n\tThe unknown, surnamed Werner, was a man fatigued by struggle. He had loved life, the theatre, society, art, literature, passionately. Endowed with an excellent memory, he spoke several languages perfectly. He was fond of dress, and had excellent manners. Of the whole group of terrorists he was the only one who was able to appear in society without risk of recognition.\n\n\tFor a long time already, and without his comrades having noticed it, he had entertained a profound contempt for men. More of a mathematician than a poet, ecstasy and inspiration had remained so far things unknown to him; at times he would look upon himself as a madman seeking to square the circle in seas of human blood. The enemy against which he daily struggled could not inspire him with respect; it was nothing but a compact network of stupidities, treasons, falsehoods, base deceits. The thing that had finally destroyed in him forever, it seemed to him, the desire to live, was his execution of a police-spy in obedience to the order of his party. He had killed him tranquilly, but at sight of this human countenance, inanimate, calm, but still false, pitiable in spite of everything, he suddenly lost his esteem for himself and his work. He considered himself as the most indifferent, the least interesting, of beings. Being a man of will, he did not leave his party; apparently he remained the same; but from that time there was something cold and terrifying in his eyes. He said nothing to anyone.\n\n\tHe possessed also a very rare quality: he knew not fear. He pitied those of his comrades who had this feeling, especially Vasily Kashirin. But his pity was cold, almost official.\n\n\tWerner understood that the execution was not simply death, but also something more. In any case, he was determined to meet it calmly, to live until the end as if nothing had happened or would happen. Only in this way could he express the profoundest contempt for the execution and preserve his liberty of mind. In the courtroom—his comrades, although knowing well his cold and haughty intrepidity, perhaps would not have believed it themselves—he thought not of life or of death: he played in his mind a difficult game of chess, giving it his deepest and quietest attention. An excellent player, he had begun this game on the very day of his imprisonment, and he kept it up continually. And the verdict that condemned him did not displace a single piece on the invisible board.\n\n\tThe idea that he probably would not finish the game did not stop Werner. On the morning of the last day he began by correcting a plan that had failed the night before. With hands pressed between his knees, he sat a long time motionless; then he arose, and began to walk, reflecting. He had a gait of his own; the upper part of his body inclined a little forward, and he brought down his heels forcibly; even when the ground was dry, he left clear footprints behind him. He whistled softly a rather simple Italian melody, which helped him to reflect.\n\n\tBut now he was shrugging his shoulders and feeling his pulse. His heart beat fast, but tranquilly and regularly, with a sonorous force. Like a novice thrown into prison for the first time, he examined attentively the cell, the bolts, the chair screwed to the wall, and said to himself:\n\n\t\n\n\tWerner's hands began to tremble, a thing unknown to him. His thought became more and more vibrant. It seemed to him that tongues of fire were moving in his head, trying to escape from his brain to lighten the still obscure distance. Finally the flame darted forth, and the horizon was brilliantly illuminated.\n\n\tThe vague lassitude that had tortured Werner during the last two years had disappeared at the sight of death; his beautiful youth came back as he played. It was even something more than beautiful youth. With the astonishing clearness of mind that sometimes lifts man to the supreme heights of meditation, Werner saw suddenly both life and death; and the majesty of this new spectacle struck him. He seemed to be following a path as narrow as the edge of a blade, on the crest of the loftiest mountain. On one side he saw life, and on the other he saw death; and they were like two deep seas, sparkling and beautiful, melting into each other at the horizon in a single infinite extension.\n\n\t said he slowly.\n\n\tHe arose involuntarily and straightened up, as if in presence of the Supreme Being. And, annihilating the walls, annihilating space and time, by the force of his all-penetrating look, he cast his eyes into the depths of the life that he had quitted.\n\n\tAnd life took on a new aspect. He no longer tried, as of old, to translate into words what he was; moreover, in the whole range of human language, still so poor and miserly, he found no words adequate. The paltry, dirty, and evil things that suggested to him contempt and sometimes even disgust at the sight of men had completely disappeared, just as, to people rising in a balloon, the mud and filth of the narrow streets become invisible and ugliness changes into beauty.\n\n\tWith an unconscious movement Werner walked toward the table and leaned upon it with his right arm. Haughty and authoritarian by nature, he had never been seen in a prouder, freer, and more imperious attitude; never had his face worn such a look, never had he so lifted up his head, for at no previous time had he been as free and powerful as now, in this prison, on the eve of execution, at the threshold of death.\n\n\tIn his illuminated eyes men wore a new aspect, an unknown beauty and charm. He hovered above time, and never had this humanity, which only the night before was howling like a wild beast in the forests, appeared to him so young. What had heretofore seemed to him terrible, unpardonable, and base became suddenly touching and naïve, just as we cherish in the child the awkwardness of its behaviour, the incoherent stammerings in which its unconscious genius glimmers, its laughable errors and blunders, its cruel bruises.\n\n\t\n\n\tWerner smiled suddenly, and his attitude lost its haughty and imposing force. Again he became the prisoner suffering in his narrow cell, weary of seeing a curious eye steadily fixed upon him through the door. He sat down, but not in his usual stiff position, and looked at the walls and the gratings with a weak and gentle smile such as his face had never worn. And something happened which had never happened to him before: he wept.\n\n\t he whispered, shedding bitter tears. \n\n\tWhat mysterious path had he followed to pass from a feeling of unlimited and haughty liberty to this passionate and moving pity? He did not know. Did he really pity his comrades, or did his tears hide something more passionate, something really greater? His heart, which had suddenly revived and reblossomed, could not tell him. Werner wept, and whispered:\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd in this man who wept, and who smiled through his tears, no one—not the judges, or his comrades, or himself—would have recognized the cold and haughty Werner, skeptical and insolent.\n\n\t\n\n\tXI\n\n\tON THE WAY TO THE GALLOWS\n\n\tBefore getting into the vehicles, all five of the condemned were gathered in a large cold room with an arched ceiling, resembling an abandoned office or an unused reception-room. They were permitted to talk with each other.\n\n\tOnly Tanya Kovalchuk took immediate advantage of the permission. The others pressed in silence hands as cold as ice or as hot as fire; dumb, trying to avoid each other's gaze, they formed a confused and distracted group. Now that they were reunited, they seemed to be ashamed of what they had felt individually in the solitude. They were afraid to look at each other, afraid to show the new, special, somewhat embarrassing thing that they felt or suspected in each other.\n\n\tNevertheless, they did look, and, after a smile or two, all found themselves at ease, as before; no change revealed itself, or, if something had happened, all had taken an equal share in it, so that nothing special was noticeable in any one of them. All talked and moved in a queer and jerky fashion, impulsively, either too slowly or too quickly. Sometimes one of them quickly repeated the same words, or else failed to finish a phrase that he had begun or thought he had already spoken. But nothing of all this did they notice. All blinkingly examined the familiar objects without recognizing them, like people who have suddenly taken off their glasses. They often turned around quickly, as if someone were calling them from the rear. But they did not notice this. The cheeks and ears of Musya and Tanya were burning. At first Sergey was a little pale; he soon recovered, and appeared as usual.\n\n\tVasily alone attracted attention. Even in such a group he was extraordinary and dreadful. Werner was moved, and said in a low voice to Musya, with deep anxiety:\n\n\t\n\n\tVasily looked at Werner from a distance, as if he had not recognized him; then he lowered his eyes.\n\n\t\n\n\tVasily did not break the silence. But, when they had already concluded that he would say absolutely nothing, there came a hollow, tardy, terribly distant reply, such as the grave might give up after a long appeal:\n\n\t\n\n\tHe repeated:\n\n\t\n\n\tWerner was delighted.\n\n\t\n\n\tBut, when his eyes met the dark and heavy gaze of Vasily, he felt a momentary anguish, asking himself:  In a tone of deep tenderness, he said:\n\n\t\n\n\t replied a tongue that moved painfully.\n\n\tSuddenly Musya seized Werner by the arm, and, expressing her astonishment forcibly, like an actress on the stage, she said:\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd Werner, also in the manner of an actor dwelling upon his words, answered, as he pressed the young girl's hand:\n\n\t\n\n\tTheir eyes met and burst into flame: everything about them became extinct, just as all other lights pale in the fugitive flash of the lightning.\n\n\t said Musya. \n\n\t he answered. \n\n\tThey had understood something and ratified it forever. With sparkling eyes and quick steps, Werner moved on again in the direction of Sergey.\n\n\t\n\n\tBut it was Tonya Kovalchuk that answered. Full of joy, almost weeping with maternal pride, she pulled Sergey violently by the sleeve.\n\n\t\n\n\t asked Werner, with a smile.\n\n\tSergey, somewhat confused, knit his brows.\n\n\t\n\n\tEverybody began to laugh. Gaining strength and firmness from their mutual communion, they gradually became again what they used to be; they did not notice it, and thought that they were always the same. Suddenly Werner stopped laughing; with perfect gravity he said to Sergey:\n\n\t\n\n\t rejoined Sergey, satisfied. \n\n\tJust then they were asked to get into the vehicles. The officials even had the amiability to allow them to place themselves in their own fashion, in pairs. In general, they were very amiable with them, even too much so; were they trying to give evidence of a little humanity, or to show that they were not responsible for what was taking place and that everything was happening of itself? It is impossible to say, but all those taking part were pale.\n\n\t said Werner, pointing the young girl to Vasily, who stood motionless.\n\n\t she answered, nodding her head. \n\n\t\n\n\tWhen they had reached the courtyard, the damp and slightly warm air fell softly upon their faces and eyes, cut their breathing, and penetrated their shivering bodies, purifying them. It was hard to believe that this stimulant was simply the wind, a spring wind, gentle and moist.\n\n\tThe astonishing spring night had a flavor of melted snow, of infinite space; it made the stones resound. Brisk and busy little drops of water fell rapidly, one after another, making a sonorous song. But, if one of them delayed a little or fell too soon, the song changed into a joyous splash, an animated confusion. Then a big drop fell heavily, and again the spring-like song began, rhythmical and sonorous. Above the city, higher than the walls of the fortress, was the pale halo formed by the electric lights.\n\n\tSergey Golovin heaved a deep sigh, and then held his breath, as if regretting to expel from his lungs air so pure and fresh.\n\n\t Werner inquired. \n\n\t they answered politely and promptly. \n\n\tOne after another the black vehicles came up, took in two persons, and went away in the darkness, toward the spot where a lantern was swinging in the gateway. Around each vehicle were moving the gray outlines of soldiers; their horses' shoes resounded loudly; often the beasts slipped on the wet snow.\n\n\tWhen Werner bent to get into the vehicle, a gendarme said to him, in a vague way:\n\n\t\n\n\tWerner was astonished.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe soldier said nothing. In a dark corner something small and motionless, but alive, lay rolled up; an open eye shone under an oblique ray of the lantern. As he sat down, Werner brushed against a knee with his foot.\n\n\t\n\n\tThere was no answer. Not until the vehicle had started did the man ask hesitatingly, in bad Russian:\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tIn two hours they would be face to face with the great mystery as yet unsolved; in two hours they would leave life for death; thither both were going; and yet they became acquainted. Life and death were marching simultaneously on two different planes, and to the very end, even in the most laughable and most stupid details, life remained life.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tFrom the sound of his voice it seemed as if Yanson were asleep. Werner found his limp hand in the darkness, and pressed it. Yanson lazily withdrew it.\n\n\t asked Werner.\n\n\t\n\n\tThey became silent. Again Werner found the Esthonian's hand, and pressed it tightly between his dry and burning palms. It remained motionless, but Yanson did not try again to release it.\n\n\tThey stifled in the cramped vehicle, whost musty smell mingled with the odors of the soldiers' uniform, of the muck-heap, and of wet leather. The breath of a young gendarme, redolent of garlic and bad tobacco, streamed continually into the face of Werner, who sat opposite. But the keen fresh air came in at the windows, and thanks to this the presence of spring was felt in the little moving box even more plainly than outside. The vehicle turned now to the right, now to the left; sometimes it seemed to turn around and go back. There were moments when it appeared to the prisoners as if they had been going in a circle for hours. At first the bluish electric light came in between the heavy lowered curtains; then suddenly, after a turn, darkness set in; it was from this that the travellers gathered that they had reached the suburbs and were approaching the station of S——. Sometimes, at a sudden turn, Werner's bent and living knee brushed in a friendly way against the bent and living knee of the gendarme, and it was hard to believe in the approaching execution.\n\n\t asked Yanson, suddenly. The continuous and prolonged shaking of the sombre vehicle gave him vertigo and a little nausea.\n\n\tWerner answered, and pressed the Esthonian's hand more tightly than before. He would have liked to say specially friendly and kind words to this little sleeping man, whom already he loved more than anyone in the world.\n\n\t\n\n\tAt first Yanson said nothing, but after a moment he replied:\n\n\t\n\n\t replied Werner, with an unlooked-for gaiety, almost laughing. He made a free-and-easy gesture, as if they were speaking of some futile and stupid prank that a band of affectionate practical jokers were trying to play upon them.\n\n\t asked Yanson.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tWerner, too, was beginning to feel the vertigo. At times it seemed to him that he was on his way to some festivity. A queer thing; almost all those who were going to the execution had the same feeling; although a prey to fear and anguish, they rejoiced vaguely in the extraordinary thing that was about to happen. Reality became intoxicated on madness, and death, coupling with life, gave birth to phantoms.\n\n\t said Werner, gay and curious, when the vehicle stopped; and he leaped lightly to the ground. Not so with Yanson, who resisted, without saying a word, very lazily it seemed, and who refused to descend. He clung to the handle of the door; the gendarme loosened his weak fingers, and grasped his arm. Ivan caught at the corner, at the door, at the high wheel, but yielded at every intervention of the gendarme. He adhered to things rather than gripped them. And it was not necessary to use much force to loosen his grasp. In short, they prevailed over him.\n\n\tAs always at night, the station was dark, deserted, and inanimate. The passenger trains had already passed, and for the train that was waiting on the track for the prisoners there was no need of light or activity. Werner was seized with ennui. He was not afraid, he was not in distress, but he was bored; an immense, heavy, fatiguing ennui filled him with a desire to go away no matter where, lie down, and close his eyes. He stretched himself, and yawned repeatedly.\n\n\t said he, wearily.\n\n\tYanson said nothing, and shuddered.\n\n\tWhen the condemned passed over the deserted platform surrounded with soldiers, on their way to the poorly-lighted railway carriages, Werner found himself placed beside Sergey Golovin. The latter designated something with his hand, and began to speak; his neighbor clearly understood only the word ; the rest of the phrase was lost in a weary and prolonged yawn.\n\n\t asked Werner, yawning also.\n\n\t said Sergey.\n\n\tWerner turned around. It was true; the glass shades were already black.\n\n\t\n\n\tSuddenly he thought:  Sergey undoubtedly had the same idea. He threw a quick glance at Werner, and turned away his head. But both stopped yawning.\n\n\tAll walked to the train without difficulty; Yanson alone had to be led. At first he stiffened his legs, and glued the soles of his feet to the platform; then he bent his knees. The entire weight of his body fell upon the arms of the policemen; his legs dragged like those of a drunken man; and the toes of his boots ground against the wooden platform. With a thousand difficulties, but in silence, they lifted him into the railway-carriage.\n\n\tVasily Kashirin himself walked unsupported; unconsciously he imitated the movements of his comrades. After mounting the steps of the carriage, he drew back; a policeman took him by the elbow to sustain him. Then Vasily began to tremble violently and uttered a piercing cry, pushing away the policeman!\n\n\t\n\n\t asked Werner rushing toward him.\n\n\tVasily kept silence, shivering the while. The policeman, vexed and even chagrined, explained:\n\n\t\n\n\t said Werner.\n\n\tHe tried to take his comrade's arm. But the latter repulsed him, and cried louder than ever.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAnd, still trembling, he entered the carriage and sat down in a corner. Werner leaned toward Musya, and asked in a low voice, designating Vasily with his eyes:\n\n\t\n\n\t answered Musya, in a whisper. \n\n\t answered Werner in a serious and thoughtful tone.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tThe slightly pallid cheeks of Musya reddened.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tThey heard a sound at the door of the railway carriage; Michka the Tzigane entered spitting, breathing noisily, and making a racket with his boot-heels. He glanced about him, and stopped short.\n\n\t he declared to the fatigued and irritated policeman. \n\n\tBut suddenly he lowered his head, stretched out his neck, and advanced towards the other prisoners. From the frame of his bushy hair and beard his black eyes shot a savage, sharp, and rather crazy look.\n\n\t he cried; \n\n\tHe sat down opposite Werner, holding out his hand; then with a wink, he leaned over and swiftly passed his hand across his companion's neck:\n\n\t\n\n\t smiled Werner.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t said the Tzigane, showing his teeth. He examined the other prisoners with a swift glance, which nevertheless dwelt longest on Musya and Yanson.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tHe took the measure of all the prisoners with a watchful, distrustful, and savage gaze. But they looked at him without a word, seriously and even with evident compassion. Again he showed his teeth, and slapped Werner several times on the knee.\n\n\t'Take care to make no sound, O forest of green oaks!' \n\n\t acquiesced the Tzigane, with satisfaction. \n\n\tHe pointed his finger at the silent policeman.\n\n\t he added, looking at Vasily. \n\n\t answered a tongue that moved with difficulty.\n\n\t\n\n\tHis eyes danced incessantly; constantly, with a hissing sound, he spat out his abundant and sweetish saliva. Yanson, doubled up motionless in a corner, slightly shook the ears of his bald fur cap, but said nothing. Werner answered for him.\n\n\t\n\n\t exclaimed the Tzigane, in astonishment. \n\n\tFor a moment he looked at Musya stealthily; then suddenly he turned, and fixed his straight and piercing gaze upon her.\n\n\t And he seized Werner's knee with his hooked fingers.\n\n\tBlushing and somewhat confused, Musya squarely returned the gaze of the attentive and savage eyes that questioned her. All kept silence.\n\n\tThe little cars bounced speedily along the narrow track. At every turn or grade-crossing the whistle blew, the engineer being afraid of crushing somebody. Was it not atrocious to think that so much care and effort, in short all human activity, was being expended in taking men to be hanged? The maddest thing in the world was being done with an air of simplicity and reasonableness. Cars were running; people were sitting in them as usual, travelling as people ordinarily travel. Then there would be a halt as usual: \n\n\tAnd then would come death—eternity—the great mystery.\n\n\t\n\n\tXII\n\n\tTHE ARRIVAL\n\n\tThe train advanced rapidly.\n\n\tSergey Golovin remembered to have spent the summer, some years before, in a little country-house along this very line. He had often travelled the road by day and by night, and knew it well. Closing his eyes, he could fancy himself returning by the last train, after staying out late at night with friends.\n\n\t thought he, straightening up: and his eyes met the dark grated window. Around him nothing stirred. Only the Tzigane kept on spitting, and his eyes ran the length of the car, seeming to touch the doors and the soldiers.\n\n\t said Vasily Kashirin between his thin lips, which seemed frozen.\n\n\tTanya Kovalchuk bestirred herself in a maternal fashion:\n\n\t\n\n\t asked Sergey, and he was frightened by his own question.\n\n\t\n\n\t added Werner.\n\n\tHe turned to Yanson, and asked him tenderly:\n\n\t\n\n\t asked Musya. \n\n\t\n\n\t said Werner.\n\n\tBut Sergey was already holding out his cigarette-case.\n\n\tAnd all began to watch tenderly Yanson's clumsy fingers as they took the cigarette and struck the match, and the little curl of bluish smoke that issued from his mouth.\n\n\t said Yanson. \n\n\t said Sergey.\n\n\t asked Werner.\n\n\t answered Sergey, unwilling to say all that he thought.\n\n\tYanson held the cigarette between his pale and living fingers. With astonishment he looked at it. And all fixed their gaze on this tiny bit of paper, on this little curl of smoke rising from the gray ashes.\n\n\tThe cigarette went out.\n\n\t said Tanya.\n\n\t\n\n\t said Werner, looking anxiously at Yanson, whose hand, holding the cigarette, hung as if dead. Suddenly the Tzigane turned, placed his face close to Werner's, and, looking into the whites of his eyes, whispered:\n\n\t\n\n\t answered Werner.\n\n\t\n\n\t said Werner. And he turned to Yanson:\n\n\t\n\n\tYanson's dried-up face wrinkled pitifully, as if someone had pulled the threads that moved the creases in his face. As in a nightmare, Yanson sobbed in a colorless voice, shedding no tears:\n\n\t\n\n\tEverybody turned toward him. Tanya, weeping copiously, stroked his arms and readjusted his fur cap.\n\n\t\n\n\tSuddenly the cars bumped into one another and began to slow up. The prisoners rose, but immediately sat down again.\n\n\t said Sergey.\n\n\tIt was as if all the air had suddenly been pumped out of the car. It became difficult to breathe. Their swollen hearts became heavy in their breasts, rose to their throats, beat desperately and their blood, in its terror, seemed to revolt. Their eyes looked at the trembling floor, their ears listened to the slowly-turning wheels, which began to turn more slowly still, and gently stopped.\n\n\tThe train halted.\n\n\tThe prisoners were plunged into a strange stupor. They did not suffer. They seemed to live an unconscious life. Their corporeal being was absent; only its phantom moved about, voiceless but speaking, silent but walking. They went out. They arranged themselves in pairs, breathing in the fresh air of the woods. Like one in a dream, Yanson struggled awkwardly: they dragged him from the car.\n\n\t asked someone, almost gaily.\n\n\t answered a careless voice.\n\n\tWithout a word they advanced into the forest, along a damp and muddy road. Their feet slipped and sank into the snow, and their hands sometimes clung involuntarily to those of their comrades. Breathing with difficulty the soldiers marched in single file, on either side of the prisoners. An irritated voice complained:\n\n\t\n\n\tA deferential voice answered:\n\n\t\n\n\tThe prisoners began to recover their consciousness. Now they seemed to grasp the idea: ; now it became obscured again, and there remained only the sense of smell, which perceived with singular keenness the strong and healthy odor of the forest; and now again all became very clear and comprehensible, the forest, and the night, and the road . . . and the certainty that very soon, in a minute, implacable death would lay its hands upon them. And little by little a whispering began.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tThey halted in the twilight. Near by, behind the trees, whose huge shadows were waving on the ground, swung silently two lanterns. There the gallows had been erected.\n\n\t said Sergey.\n\n\t asked Werner, not understanding.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tVasily was standing close by them, gloomy and motionless.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tThey looked at each other, their eyes avoiding the silent and terrible significant swaying of the lanterns. At the left the thin forest seemed to be growing lighter. And beyond, something vast and gray and flat appeared, whence came a moist breeze.\n\n\t said Sergey, sucking in the damp air. \n\n\tMusya answered by a line from the song:\n\n\t \n\n\t'The shores of life cannot contain  My love as broad as is the sea.'My love as broad as is the sea,''My love as broad as is the sea,'Musya, my little Musya, how young you still are!Sir, sir, look at the forest. My God! What is all that? And yonder! The lanterns! My God, is that the scaffold?We must say our farewells,Wait! They still have to read the sentence. Where is Yanson?Well, doctor, will you soon be through?It's nothing. A fainting fit. Rub his ears with snow. He is better already. You can read.Gentlemen, perhaps it is better not to read. You all know the sentence.Do not read!No nonsense, father; you will forgive me, they will hang me.Gentlemen, you will go in pairs, choosing your companion. But I beg you to make haste.I will go with him. You, Sergey, take Vasily. You go first.All right.I am going with you, Musya,Come, let us kiss each other!Good-bye, comrades.Good-bye, comrade,Oh! My God!They are going to hang us.God! Am I to be hanged alone? My God!Sir, my dear sir, my good sir. You will come with me, won't you?I cannot; I am with Yanson.Oh! My God! then I shall be alone. Why? Why?I will go with you.Will you?Yes.But you are so little! You are not afraid of me? No, I don't want you to. I will go alone.But I am not afraid of you.Don't you know that I am a brigand? And you are willing to go with me? Think a moment. I shall not be angry if you refuse.Where are you going?Stay!Milksop, pick up your gun, or I will pick it up for you,You don't know your duty. Have you never seen a man die?Good-bye, sir!We shall meet again in the other world. When you see me there, don't turn away from me.Good-bye!I must not be hanged,And I, Musya? Am I then to go alone?We have lived together, and now . . .Tanya, my good Tanya!Miss,you are able to go alone. You have a pure soul. You can go alone where you like. But I cannot. I am a bandit. I cannot go alone. 'Where are you going?' they will say to me, 'you who have killed, you who have stolen?' For I have stolen horses, too, Miss. And with her I shall be as if I were with an innocent child. Do you understand?Yes, I understand. Go on then! Let me kiss you once more, Musya.Kiss each other! Kiss each other!You are women. You must say good-bye to each other.I am left alone,Sergey is dead, Werner and Vasily are dead. And Musya is dying. I am alone. Soldiers, my little soldiers, you see, I am alone, alone . . .'\n\n\tThe sun appeared above the sea. . . .\n\n\tThey placed the bodies in boxes, and started off with them. With elongated necks, bulging eyes, and blue tongues protruding from their mouths, the dead retraced the road by which, living, they had come.\n\n\tAnd the snow was still soft, and the air of the forest was still pure and balmy.\n\n\tOn the white road lay the black rubber that Sergey had lost. . . .\n\n\tThus it was that men greeted the rising sun.\n\n\t               Add  The Seven That Were Hanged to your library.
