 said the Snow Man,  He meant the sun, who was just setting. \n\n\tHe had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes; his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth. He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips. The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue.\n\n\t said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more. \n\n\t barked the old yard-dog. He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce  properly. He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since. \n\n\t said the Snow Man. You know nothing at all,but then, you've only lately been patched up. What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun. It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; for I think the weather is going to change. I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change.I don't understand him,but I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable. The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too.Away, away,This is really beautiful,Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time,he is capital.Who are these two?You have been here longer than I have; do you know them?Of course I know them,she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat. I never bite those two.But what are they?They are lovers,they will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone. Away, away!Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?Well, they belong to the same master,Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little. I can see that in you. I have age and experience. I know every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time when I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain. Away, away!The cold is delightful,but do tell me tell me; only you must not clank your chain so; for it jars all through me when you do that.Away, away!I'll tell you; they said I was a pretty little fellow once; then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap. They used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.' But after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room; so I came to live on the lower story. You can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was master once; for I was indeed master to the housekeeper. It was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs; but I was more comfortable; for I was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been. I received quite as good food, or even better. I had my own cushion, and there was a stove- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year. I used to go under the stove, and lie down quite beneath it. Ah, I still dream of that stove. Away, away!Does a stove look beautiful?is it at all like me?It is just the reverse of you,' said the dog; \n\n\tThen the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it. The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him; it was very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it. But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is.  asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex. \n\n\t replied the yard-dog. \n\n\tBut the Snow Man was no longer listening. He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey; where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself.  he said. \n\n\t said the yard-dog, \n\n\t said the Snow Man, \n\n\tDuring the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth; this is customary with all stoves. The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam.  said he; \n\n\tThe night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold. In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice. They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove. These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him; it was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy. But he did not enjoy it; how, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was \n\n\t said the yard-dog;  he barked and then he added,  And the weather did change; it began to thaw. As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign. One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; and, behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. It was the pole round which the boys had built him up.  said the yard-dog.  The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his body; that was what moved him so.  And soon the winter passed.  barked the hoarse yard-dog. But the girls in the house sang,\n\n\tAnd nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.\n\n\t               Add  The Snow Man to your library.
