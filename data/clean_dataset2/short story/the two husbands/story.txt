  replied her companion.  A slight change was perceptible in the countenance of Jane Emory, and for a moment the color deepened on her cheek. But when she spoke in reply to her friend's remark, no indication that she felt its cutting import, was perceptible.  said Jane,     These should not only be respected, but honored wherever found,' said Jane, gravely.  Cara responded, in a tone of irony.      replied Jane, her manner becoming more serious,    said Jane, interrupting her friend.     asked Jane smiling.    Jane remarked, drily.  said Cara, tossing her head, for she felt that something by no means complimentary was implied in the equivocal remark of her friend.   said Cara, warming suddenly,     replied Jane, seriously,       said Cara.   her friend replied.    Jane remarked, quietly.     Cara shook her head as her friend ceased speaking, and replied, laughingly--  The two young men whose merits Jane Emory and Cara Linton had thus been discussing, had been law students for some years in the same office, and were now just admitted to practice at the bar in one of our Atlantic cities. They were friends, though altogether unlike each other. Walter Gray was modest and retiring, while Charles Wilton was a dashing, off-hand kind of a fellow, with more pretensions than merit. The mind of Walter was rather sluggish, while that of his friend was quick, and what some were disposed to esteem brilliant. The one was fond of dress and show, and effect; while the other paid less regard to these things than was really necessary to make him, with many, an agreeable companion. But the quick perceptions of the one were not equal to the patient, untiring application of the other. When admitted to practice, Wilton could make an effective, brilliant speech, and in ordinary cases, where an appeal to the feelings could influence a jury, was uniformly successful. But, where profound investigation, concise reasoning, and a laborious array of authorities were requisite, he was no competitor for his friend Gray. He was vain of his personal appearance, as has before been indicated, and was also fond of pleasure and company. In short, he was one of those dashing young men to be met with in all professions, who look upon business as an necessary evil, to be escaped whenever a opportunity offers--whose expectations of future prosperity are always large, and who look for success, not in the roads of patient, laborious application, but by a quicker and more brilliant way. They hope to produce a sensation by their tact or talents, and thus take fortune by storm. Few, indeed we might say none, of this class succeed. Those who startle a community by rapid advances, are, in all cases, such as have, to quick perceptions and brilliant powers, added much labor. Talent is nothing without prolonged and patient application; and they who suppose the road to success lies in any other way, may discover their error too late. The estimation in which the characters of these two young men was held, at least by two individuals, the preceding conversation has apprised the reader. Each made his impression upon a certain order of mind, and each was regarded, or lightly esteemed accordingly. Although in talents and in a right estimation of life and its true ends, the two young men were altogether dissimilar; yet were they friends, and in many respects intimate. Why they were so, we shall not stop to enquire, but proceed to introduce them more particularly to the reader.  said Wilton to his friend, a few weeks after the period indicated in the opening of this story.        'You are too matter-of-fact, by half, Walter. Your common sense ideas, as you call them, will keep you grubbing in a mole hill all your life.          Wilton responded.    Charles Wilton replied, assuming an attitude and speaking out truly the thoughts that were in his mind;       Nonsense! What do I, or what does any one else care about society? My motto is, Every one for himself, and the deuce take the hindmost. And that's the motto of the whole world.'     Wilton replied with emphasis.  And so saying, he turned, and left the office. That evening, amid a gay and fashionable assemblage at Mrs. Merton's, was to be seen the showy Charles Wilton, with his easy, and even elegant manners, attracting almost as much attention as his vain heart could desire. And the quiet, sensible Walter Gray was there also, looking upon all things with a calm, philosophic mein.  remarked Jane Emory, who was leaning upon the arm of Walter Gray, and listening with an interest she scarcely dared confess to herself, to his occasional remarks, that indicated a mind active with true and healthful thought.  replied Walter, with a pleasant tone and smile.  his companion said, though with nothing censorious in her manner. She merely expressed a sentiment without showing that it excited unkind feelings.  was the quick response.      Walter Gray turned a look full of tender interest upon the maiden by his side, as she ceased speaking, and said in a tone that had in it much of tenderness,  For a few moments Jane did not reply. She feared to utter any form of words that would mislead. At length she said, modestly,  Before Walter Gray, pleased with the answer, could frame in his mind a fitting reply, Charles Wilton, with Cara Linton on his arm, was thrown in front of them.  said Wilton, gaily.  Neither Walter nor his fair companion were what is called quick-witted; and both were so checked in their thoughts and feelings that neither could, on the moment, fitly reply.  the gay young man continued.  And the young man and his thoughtless companion turned laughing away. For a few moments the disturbed thoughts of Walter and his fair friend, trembled upon the surface of their feelings, and then all was again as tranquil as the bosom of a quiet lake. Enough has now been said, to give a fair idea of the ends which the two young men, we have introduced, set before them upon entering life. Let us now proceed to trace the effects of these ends; effects, which, as a necessary consequence, involved others as much as themselves. Chapter II  said Wilton, one day, coming into the office of the individual he addressed so familiarly.    said Wilton, with a smile.              Wilton asked, without regarding the last remark of his friend.             Walter Gray looked his friend in the face for a moment or two, but did not reply. He was pained, even shocked at his levity.  said Wilton, after a pause.    was the calm response,   And so saying, Charles Wilton left the office of his friend. A few weeks more passed away, and the two young men had, in the meantime, consummated their matrimonial engagements. The wedding of Charles Wilton and Cara Linton was a splendid affair, succeeded by parties and entertainments for five or six weeks. That of Walter Gray and Jane Emory passed off more quietly and rationally. Three months after their wedding-day, let us look in upon the two friends and their fair partners; and first, upon Charles Wilton and his bride. The time is evening, and they are sitting alone in one of their richly furnished parlors.  yawned out Wilton, rising and walking backwards and forwards,                His young wife sighed, but Wilton did not notice it.  he at length said.  his wife replied.  said Wilton, pettishly. His wife burst into tears, and sat sobbing for some minutes, during which time Wilton paced the room backwards and forwards, in moody silence. After a while his wife rose up and stole quietly from the room, and in a few minutes returned, dressed, to go out.  she said.       said his wife, while her voice trembled and sounded harshly.  For a moment longer Wilton hesitated, and then took up his hat and went with her. Few were the words that passed between them as they walked along the street. Arrived at their friend's house they both suddenly changed, and were as gay, and seemed as happy, as the gayest and the happiest.  asked Walter Gray, taking a seat upon the sofa beside his happy wife, on the same evening that the foregoing conversation and incidents occurred.  was the affectionate, truthful reply.      A pause of a few moments ensued, when Mrs. Gray said,   These brief conversations will indicate to the reader how each of the young men and their wives were thus early beginning to reap the fruits of true and false principles of action. We cannot trace each on his career, step by step, during the passage of many years, though much that would interest and instruct could be gathered from their histories. The limits of a brief story like this will not permit us thus to linger. On, then, to the grand result of their lives we must pass. Let us look at the summing up of the whole matter, and see which of the young men started with the true secret of success in the world, and which of the young ladies evinced most wisdom in her choice of a husband. Chapter III  remarked Mrs. Gray, now a cheerful, intelligent woman of forty, with half-a-dozen grown and half-grown up daughters,   said Mrs. Gray's visitor, whom she had addressed.       The truth of the remark, as applicable in this case, struck Mrs. Gray forcibly, and she mused in thoughtful silence for a few moments.  said a lawyer, addressing the individual he had named, about the same hour that the conversation, just noted, occurred.    said the Judge, in tones of painful surprise.      Judge Gray leaned his head upon his hand, and, with his eyes cast upon the floor, sat for some moments in painful thought.  he at length said, looking up.   remarked the individual he was addressing. Judge Gray did not reply, but cast his eyes again upon the floor.  continued the lawyer,   remarked the Judge, musingly.  And thus saying, the lawyer turned away, and left Judge Gray to his own thoughts.  said Judge Gray, coming into the room where sat his wife, an hour afterwards.  asked Mrs. Gray, looking up with a concerned countenance.   Mrs. Gray said in a sad tone.      On the next morning all the city papers teemed with accounts of the late forgery, and blazoned Charles Wilton's name, with many opprobrious epithets before the public. Some went even so far as to allude to his wife, whom they said he had forsaken years before, and who was now, it was alleged, living in poverty, and, some hinted in disgrace and infamy. Early in the day, Mrs. Gray repaired to the cheerless home of her early friend. She was shown to her chamber, where she found her lying insensible on the bed, with one of the newspapers in her hand, that alluded to herself in disgraceful terms. Long and patient efforts to restore her, at length produced the desired result. But it was many days before she seemed distinctly conscious of what was passing or would converse with any degree of coherency.  Mrs. Gray said to her, one day, on calling in to see her;  There was a sad, but grateful expression in the pale face of Mrs. Wilton, as she looked into the eye of her old friend, but ventured no reply.  urged Mrs. Gray.  said she bitterly.   and the tears filled her eyes, and glistened through the lids which were closed suddenly over them.  Mrs. Gray urged, taking her hand and gently pressing it. That evening Mrs. Wilton spent in the pleasant family of her old friend. Three weeks afterwards, Mrs. Gray asked of her husband, if anything had been heard of Mr. Wilton.  he replied.    said her husband.  The home was accordingly offered, and tearfully accepted.  said the sad hearted woman,  and the heart-stricken creature bowed her head and wept. And now, kind reader, if there be one who has followed us thus far, are you disappointed in not meeting some startling denoument, or some effective point in this narrative. I hope not. Natural results have followed, in just order, the adoption of true and false principles of action--and thus will they ever follow. Learn, then, a lesson from the history of the two young men and the maidens of their choice. Let every young man remember, that all permanent success in life depends upon the adoption of such principles of action as are founded in honesty and truth; and let every young woman take it to heart, that all her married life will be affected by the principles which her husband sets down as rules of action. Let her give no consideration to his brilliant prospect, or his brilliant mind, if sound moral principles do not govern him.  I hear a bright-eyed maiden asking, as she turns half impatient from my homily. Wilton has escaped justice thus far, and his wife, growing more and more cheerful every day, is still the inmate of Judge Gray's family, and I trust will remain so until the end of her journeying here. And what is more, she is learning the secret, that there is more happiness in caring for others, than in being all absorbed in selfish consideration. Still, she is a sad wreck upon the stream of life--a warning beacon for your eyes, young lady.                     Add  The Two Husbands to your library.
