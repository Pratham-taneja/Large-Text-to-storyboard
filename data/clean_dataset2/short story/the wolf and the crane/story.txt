A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.\n\n\tSo away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.\n\n\t said the Wolf, 'if you pull that bone out for me.'\n\n\tThe Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.\n\n\tWhen the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.\n\n\t called the Crane anxiously.\n\n\t snarled the Wolf, whirling around. 'Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?'\n\n\tExpect no reward for serving the wicked.\n\n\t               Add  The Wolf And The Crane to your library.
