A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.\n\n\tThe Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone:\n\n\t\n\n\tThe Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said:\n\n\t'Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?'\n\n\tWhat is evil won is evil lost.\n\n\t               Add  The Wolf And The Lion to your library.
