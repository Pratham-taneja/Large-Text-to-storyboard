I WILL tell you a story that was told me when I was a little boy. Every time I thought of this story, it seemed to me more and more charming; for it is with stories as it is with many people- they become better as they grow older.\n\n\tI have no doubt that you have been in the country, and seen a very old farmhouse, with a thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing wild upon it. There is a stork's nest on the ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the stork. The walls of the house are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter is made to open. The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob. An elder-tree hangs over the palings; and beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water, in which a few ducks are disporting themselves. There is a yard-dog too, who barks at all corners. Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane; and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant and his wife. Small as their possessions were, they had one article they could not do without, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon the grass which it found by the side of the high road. The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed it of him, and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple. After a time they thought it would be as well to sell the horse, or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them. But what might this something be?\n\n\t said the wife. \n\n\tAnd she fastened his neckerchief for him; for she could do that better than he could, and she could also tie it very prettily in a double bow. She also smoothed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand, and gave him a kiss. Then he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold or bartered for something else. Yes, the old man knew what he was about. The sun shone with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. The road was very dusty; for a number of people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding, or walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere from the hot sunshine. Among the rest a man came trudging along, and driving a cow to the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be.\n\n\t said the peasant to himself.  he said. \n\n\t said the man.\n\n\tAccordingly the exchange was made; and as the matter was settled, the peasant might have turned back; for he had done the business he came to do. But, having made up his mind to go to the fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it; so on he went to the town with his cow. Leading the animal, he strode on sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man who was driving a sheep. It was a good fat sheep, with a fine fleece on its back.\n\n\t said the peasant to himself. \n\n\tThe man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was quickly made. And then our peasant continued his way on the high-road with his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another man, who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a large goose under his arm.\n\n\t said the peasant; \n\n\tThe other had not the least objection, and accordingly the exchange was made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose. By this time he had arrived very near the town. The crowd on the high road had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a rush of men and cattle. The cattle walked on the path and by the palings, and at the turnpike-gate they even walked into the toll-keeper's potato-field, where one fowl was strutting about with a string tied to its leg, for fear it should take fright at the crowd, and run away and get lost. The tail-feathers of the fowl were very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very cunning, as it said  What were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this I cannot tell you; but directly our good man saw it, he thought,  he asked the toll-keeper.\n\n\t repeated the man; \n\n\tAnd so they made an exchange,- the toll-keeper at the turnpike-gate kept the goose, and the peasant carried off the fowl. Now he had really done a great deal of business on his way to the fair, and he was hot and tired. He wanted something to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself; so he turned his steps to an inn. He was just about to enter when the ostler came out, and they met at the door. The ostler was carrying a sack.  asked the peasant.\n\n\t answered the ostler; \n\n\t he replied; \n\n\t asked the ostler.\n\n\t\n\n\tSo he gave up the fowl, and received the apples, which he carried into the inn parlor. He leaned the sack carefully against the stove, and then went to the table. But the stove was hot, and he had not thought of that. Many guests were present- horse dealers, cattle drovers, and two Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich that their pockets quite bulged out and seemed ready to burst; and they could bet too, as you shall hear.  What could that be by the stove? The apples were beginning to roast.  asked one.\n\n\t- said our peasant. And then he told them the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and all the rest of it, down to the apples.\n\n\t said one of the Englishmen. \n\n\t said the peasant. \n\n\t said the Englishmen. \n\n\t replied the peasant. \n\n\t and so the bet was made.\n\n\tThen the landlord's coach came to the door, and the two Englishmen and the peasant got in, and away they drove, and soon arrived and stopped at the peasant's hut.   \n\n\t said the woman. Then she embraced him, and paid no attention to the strangers, nor did she notice the sack.\n\n\t\n\n\t said she. \n\n\t\n\n\t cried the wife. \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t replied the woman. \n\n\t\n\n\t exclaimed the wife.  and then she gave him a hearty kiss.\n\n\t said both the Englishmen;  So they paid a hundred-weight of gold to the peasant, who, whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed.\n\n\tYes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that her husband knows best, and whatever he does is right.\n\n\tThat is a story which I heard when I was a child; and now you have heard it too, and know that \n\n\t               Add  What The Old Man Does Is Always Right to your library.
