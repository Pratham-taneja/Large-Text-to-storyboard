	Brother Lustig went his way and came to a place where there was a magnificent castle, and not far from it a wretched inn. He went to the inn and asked for a night's lodging, but the landlord turned him away, and said, 'There is no more room here, the house is full of noble guests.' 'It surprises me that they should come to you and not go to that splendid castle,' said Brother Lustig. 'Ah, indeed,' replied the host, 'but it is no slight matter to sleep there for a night; no one who has tried it so far, has ever come out of it alive.'
