	Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him. The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging to it. 'Good evening, mother.' 'Good evening, Hans.' 'Where hast thou been?' 'With Grethel.' 'What didst thou take her?' 'I took her nothing, she gave me something.' 'What did Grethel give thee?' 'Gave me a bit of bacon.' 'Where is the bacon, Hans?' 'I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took it.' 'That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have carried the bacon on thy head.' 'Never mind, will do better next time.' 'Whither away, Hans?' 'To Grethel, mother.' 'Behave well, Hans.' 'I'll behave well. Good-bye, mother.' 'Good-bye, Hans.'
