On this he ran hastily to her, lifted her up and bore her into a chamberâ-then he laid her down, and knelt and sucked the three drops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out. Immediately she breathed again and recovered herself, but the young King had seen this, and being ignorant why Faithful John had done it, was angry and cried, 'Throw him into a dungeon.' Next morning Faithful John was condemned, and led to the gallows, and when he stood on high, and was about to be executed, he said, 'Every one who has to die is permitted before his end to make one last speech; may I too claim the right?' 'Yes,' answered the King, 'it shall be granted unto thee.' Then said Faithful John, 'I am unjustly condemned, and have always been true to thee,' and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the ravens when on the sea, and how he had been obliged to do all these things in order to save his master. Then cried the King, 'Oh, my most Faithful John. Pardon, pardonâ-bring him down.' But as Faithful John spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a stone.
