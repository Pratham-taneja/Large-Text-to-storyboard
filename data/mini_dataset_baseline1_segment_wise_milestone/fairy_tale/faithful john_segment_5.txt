	Faithful John bade the King stay behind on the ship, and wait for him. 'Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,' said he, 'therefore see that everything is in order; have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated.' Then he gathered together in his apron all kinds of gold things, went on shore and walked straight to the royal palace. When he entered the courtyard of the palace, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two golden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them. And when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger, and asked who he was. So he answered, 'I am a merchant,' and opened his apron, and let her look in. Then she cried, 'Oh, what beautiful gold things!' and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other. Then said the girl, 'The princess must see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have.' She took him by the hand and led him upstairs, for she was the waiting-maid. When the King's daughter saw the wares, she was quite delighted and said, 'They are so beautifully worked, that I will buy them all of thee.' But Faithful John said, 'I am only the servant of a rich merchant. The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship. They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold.' She wanted to have everything brought to her there, but he said, 'There are so many of them that it would take a great many days to do that, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your house is not big enough.' Then her curiosity and longing were still more excited, until at last she said, 'Conduct me to the ship, I will go there myself, and behold the treasures of thine master.'
