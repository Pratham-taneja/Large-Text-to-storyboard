	When he was going out of the church, the beggar said, 'Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.' But he gave a key to the nurse, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him. Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other; but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, 'Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?' 'Oh, yes,' said the father, 'thou hadst a key if there is a castle standing on the heath, just go to it and open it.' Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of.
