	After seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle. When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse, a white one. Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father. 'Now I have a white horse, and I will travel,' said he. So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road. At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, 'Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.' As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, 'Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.' He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up. When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, 'Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee get into the water,' and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake. Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, 'As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.' Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going. 'Oh, to the next place.' Then what his name was? 'Ferdinand the Faithful.' 'So! then we have got almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful.' And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place.
