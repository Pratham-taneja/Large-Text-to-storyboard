	Said she, ''Tis well, then I am certainly at home already,' and ran away.

	Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal. Then she went to them and said, 'I will help you to steal.' The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place, and were willing. Catherine went in front of the houses, and cried, 'Good folks, have you anything? We want to steal.' The thieves thought to themselves, 'That's a fine way of doing things,' and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine. Then they said to her, 'Outside the village the pastor has some turnips in the field. Go there and pull up some turnips for us.' Catherine went to the ground, and began to pull them up, but was so idle that she did not gather them together. Then a man came by, saw her, and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus rooting amongst the turnips. He ran away into the village to the pastor, and said, 'Mr. Pastor, the devil is in your turnip-ground, rooting up turnips.' 'Ah, heavens,' answered the pastor, 'I have a lame foot, I cannot go out and drive him away.' Said the man, 'Then I will carry you on my back,' and he carried him out on his back. And when they came to the ground, Catherine arose and stood up her full height. 'Ah, the devil!' cried the pastor, and both hurried away, and in his great fright the pastor could run better with his lame foot than the man who had carried him on his back could do with his sound one.
