Lina saw this and said, 'Hark you, old Sanna, why are you fetching so much water?' 'If thou wilt never repeat it to anyone, I will tell thee why.' So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said, 'Early to-morrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.'
