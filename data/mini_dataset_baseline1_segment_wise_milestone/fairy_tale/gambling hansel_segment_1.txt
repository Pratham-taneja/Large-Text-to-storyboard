Upon this St. Peter said to the Lord, 'Lord, this thing must not go on, he will win, and thou lose, the whole world. We must send Death to him.' When Death appeared, Gambling Hansel had just seated himself at the gaming-table, and Death said, 'Hansel, come out a while.' But Gambling Hansel said, 'Just wait a little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into that tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have something to munch on our way.' Thereupon Death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and Gambling Hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died.
