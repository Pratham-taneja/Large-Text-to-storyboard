	So St. Peter said to the Lord, 'Lord, this thing must not go on. People no longer die; we must go ourselves.' And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down. So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, 'Come down,' and Death took him directly and put an end to him. They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it. 'Who is there?' 'Gambling Hansel.' 'Ah, we will have nothing to do with him! Begone!' So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more. 'Who is there?' 'Gambling Hansel.' 'Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him. We do not want to gamble, just go away again.' Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in. There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world. And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again. Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, 'Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.' And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, 'Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.' So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day.
