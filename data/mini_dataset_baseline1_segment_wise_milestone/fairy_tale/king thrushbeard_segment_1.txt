	Once the King made a great feast and invited thereto, from far and near, all the young men likely to marry. They were all marshalled in a row according to their rank and standing; first came the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the princes, the earls, the barons, and the gentry. Then the King's daughter was led through the ranks, but to every one she had some objection to make; one was too fat, 'The wine-cask,' she said. Another was too tall, 'Long and thin has little in.' The third was too short, 'Short and thick is never quick.' The fourth was too pale, 'As pale as death.' The fifth too red, 'A fighting-cock.' The sixth was not straight enough, 'A green log dried behind the stove.'
