	A few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows, trying to earn a small alms. When the King heard him he said, 'Let him come up.' So the fiddler came in, in his dirty, ragged clothes, and sang before the King and his daughter, and when he had ended he asked for a trifling gift. The King said, 'Your song has pleased me so well that I will give you my daughter there, to wife.'
