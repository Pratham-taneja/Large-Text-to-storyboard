	For some time they were alone like this in the wilderness. But it happened that the King of the country held a great hunt in the forest. Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs, and the merry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the roebuck heard all, and was only too anxious to be there. 'Oh,' said he, to his sister, 'let me be off to the hunt, I cannot bear it any longer;' and he begged so much that at last she agreed. 'But,' said she to him, 'come back to me in the evening; I must shut my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, 'My little sister, let me in!' that I may know you; and if you do not say that, I shall not open the door.' Then the young roebuck sprang away; so happy was he and so merry in the open air.
