	The first heat of the first race come off and the young fellow setting there with the two girls left them and went down to make a bet. I knew what he was up to, but he didnât talk big and noisy and let everyone around know he was a sport as some do. He wasnât that kind. Well, he come back and I heard him tell the two girls what horse heâd bet on, and when the heat was trotted they all half got to their feet and acted in the excited, sweaty way people do when theyâve got money down on a race, and the horse they bet on is up there pretty close at the end, and they think maybe heâll come on with a rush, but he never does because he hasnât got the old juice in him, come right down to it.
