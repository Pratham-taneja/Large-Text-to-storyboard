	So Bob had the horses and he did pretty much as he pleased and you canât blame Bob, at least, I never did. Sometimes he was out to win and sometimes he wasnât. I never cared much about that when I was swiping a horse. What I did want to know was that my horse had the speed and could go out in front if you wanted him to.
