	But after all I had to work, and there was no other work to be got. A big lumbering fellow of nineteen couldnât just hang around the house and I had got too big to mow peopleâs lawns and sell newspapers. Little chaps who could get next to peopleâs sympathies by their sizes were always getting jobs away from me. There was one fellow who kept saying to everyone who wanted a lawn mowed or a cistern cleaned, that he was saving money to work his way through college, and I used to lay awake nights thinking up ways to injure him without being found out. I kept thinking of wagons running over him and bricks falling on his head as he walked along the street. But never mind him.
