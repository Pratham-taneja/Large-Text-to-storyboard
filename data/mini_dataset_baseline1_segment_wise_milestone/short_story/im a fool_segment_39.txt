	I told about our place down at Marietta, and about the big stables and the grand brick house we had on a hill, up above the Ohio River, but I knew enough not to do it in no bragging way. What I did was to start things and then let them drag the rest out of me. I acted just as reluctant to tell as I could. Our family hasnât got any barrel factory, and since Iâve known us, weâve always been pretty poor, but not asking anything of anyone at that, and my grandfather, over in Walesâbut never mind that.
