	And I was with that girl and she wasnât saying much, and I wasnât saying much either. One thing I know. She wasnât stuck on me because of the lie about my father being rich and all that. Thereâs a way you know â¦ Craps amighty. Thereâs a kind of girl you see just once in your life, and if you donât get busy and make hay, then youâre gone for good and all, and might as well go jump off a bridge. They give you a look from inside of them somewhere, and it ainât no vamping, and what it means isâyou want that girl to be your wife, and you want nice things around her like flowers and swell clothes, and you want her to have the kids youâre going to have, and you want good music played and no ragtime. Gee whizz.
