	Thereâs a place over near Sandusky, across a kind of bay, and itâs called Cedar Point. And after we had supper we went over to it in a launch, all by ourselves. Wilbur and Miss Lucy and that Miss Woodbury had to catch a ten oâclock train back to Tiffin, Ohio, because, when youâre out with girls like that, you canât get careless and miss any trains and stay out all night, like you can with some kinds of Janes.
