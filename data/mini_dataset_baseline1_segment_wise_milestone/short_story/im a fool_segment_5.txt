	We set out from home late in July in a box car with the two horses and after that, until late November, we kept moving along to the race meets and the fairs. It was a peachy time for me, Iâll say that. Sometimes now I think that boys who are raised regular in houses, and never have a fine n----- like Burt for best friend, and go to high schools and college, and never steal anything, or get drunk a little, or learn to swear from fellows who know how, or come walking up in front of a grandstand in their shirt sleeves and with dirty horsey pants on when the races are going on and the grandstand is full of people all dressed upâwhatâs the use of talking about it? Such fellows donât know nothing at all. Theyâve never had no opportunity.
