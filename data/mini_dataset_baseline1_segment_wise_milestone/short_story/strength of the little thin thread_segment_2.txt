	'Now the whole thing was like a play in one of your theatresâit was staged, dear one, and well staged. The scene was the great hall in which meets the caste tribunal of a certain Brahmin clan. Imagine, if you please, a huge quadrangle, impressively bare but for a low dais at one end. covered with a few Bengali shawls and an antelope skin or twoâah!âand then the dramatic atmosphere. Not the atmosphere of deathâoh, no!âmuch worse than death, much worse. For what is death compared to the loss of caste? And that afternoon they were going to try a man who had polluted his blood, who had sinned a great sin, a sin more heinous than the killing of cowsânot a sin according to your code of lawsâbut then they were men of a different race, and their ins are not your sinsâeh?âand mayhap their virtues may not be your virtues.
