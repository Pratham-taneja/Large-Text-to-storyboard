	What I am trying to say is this--

	By God I made their minds flee out of them.

	Their minds came out of them as clear and straight as anything could be.

	I said they might build temples to their lives.

	I threw my words at faces floating in a street.

	I threw my words like stones, like building stones.

	I scattered words in alleyways like seeds.

	I crept at night and threw my words in empty rooms of houses in a street.
