A Rabbit left his home one day for a dinner of clover. But he forgot to latch the door of his house and while he was gone a Weasel walked in and calmly made himself at home. When the Rabbit returned, there was the Weasel's nose sticking out of the Rabbit's own doorway, sniffing the fine air.

	The Rabbit was quite angryâfor a Rabbitâ, and requested the Weasel to move out. But the Weasel was perfectly content. He was settled down for good.
