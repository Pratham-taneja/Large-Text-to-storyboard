	Come in, said the king, as John knocked at the door. John opened it, and the old king, in a dressing gown and embroidered slippers, came towards him. He had the crown on his head, carried his sceptre in one hand, and the orb in the other. Wait a bit, said he, and he placed the orb under his arm, so that he could offer the other hand to John; but when he found that John was another suitor, he began to weep so violently, that both the sceptre and the orb fell to the floor, and he was obliged to wipe his eyes with his dressing gown. Poor old king! Let her alone, he said; you will fare as badly as all the others. Come, I will show you. Then he led him out into the princess's pleasure gardens, and there he saw a frightful sight. On every tree hung three or four kings sons who had wooed the princess, but had not been able to guess the riddles she gave them. Their skeletons rattled in every breeze, so that the terrified birds never dared to venture into the garden. All the flowers were supported by human bones instead of sticks, and human skulls in the flower-pots grinned horribly. It was really a doleful garden for a princess. Do you see all this? said the old king; your fate will be the same as those who are here, therefore do not attempt it. You really make me very unhappy,I take these things to heart so very much.
