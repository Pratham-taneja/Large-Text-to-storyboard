An old grandmother, poorly cladâshe belonged to the working classâwas following one of the under-servants into the great empty throne-room, for this was the apartment she wanted to seeâthat she was resolved to see; it had cost her many a little sacrifice, and many a coaxing word, to penetrate thus far. She folded her thin hands, and looked round with an air of reverence, as if she had been in a church.
