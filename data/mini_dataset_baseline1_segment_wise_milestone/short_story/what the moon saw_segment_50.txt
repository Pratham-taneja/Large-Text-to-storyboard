'I know very well what is the matter with you,' she said; 'yes, you're in love!' And he could not help laughing. 'I and Love,' he cried, 'that would have an absurd look. How the public would shout!' 'Certainly, you are in love,' she continued; and added with a comic pathos, 'and I am the person you are in love with.' You see, such a thing may be said when it is quite out of the questionâand, indeed, Pulcinella burst out laughing, and gave a leap into the air, and his melancholy was forgotten.
