Two Frogs lived together in a marsh. But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them. By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, 'This looks a nice cool place: let us jump in and settle here.' But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, 'Not so fast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?'\n\n\tThink twice before you act.      8.3                Add  The Frogs and the Well to your library.
