These sketches taken from letters hastily written
in the leisure moments of a very busy life make
no pretension to literary merit, but are simply a brief
record of one person's hospital experience. As such
they are republished, with their many faults but partially amended lest in retouching they should lose
whatever force or freshness the inspiration of the time
may have given them.\n\n\tTo those who have objected to a tone of levity in
some portions of the sketches, I desire to say that the
wish to make the best of every thing, and send home
cheerful reports even from that saddest of scenes, an
army hospital, probably produced the impression of
levity upon those who have never known the sharp
contrasts of the tragic and comic in such a life.\n\n\tThat Nurse Periwinkle gave no account of her
religious services, thereby showing a "sad want of
Christian experience," can only be explained by the
fact that it would have as soon occurred to her to
print the letters written for the men, their penitent
confidences or their dying messages, as to mention
the prayers she prayed, the hymns she sang, the
sacred words she rend; while the "Christian
experience she was receiving then and there
was far too deep and earnest to be recorded in a newspaper.\n\n\tThe unexpected favor with which the little book
was greeted, and the desire for a new edition, increase
the author's regret that it be not more worthy of such a
kind reception,\n\n\tL.M.A.
