Jack and Jill: A Village Story (1880) is a children's book set in a small New England town after the Civil War. They tumble down a hill in a sledding accident, just like their famous characters in the Mother Goose rhyme, and are bedridden for months. This story is about how they and their parents engage their active imaginations in fighting boredom!\n\n\tYou may enjoy our other chapter books in Books for Young Readers\n\n\tChapter 1.
