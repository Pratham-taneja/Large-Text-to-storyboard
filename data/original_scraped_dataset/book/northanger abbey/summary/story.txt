Northanger Abbey was Austen's first novel (1803) but it was not published until after her death in 1817. Catherine, one of ten children of a clergyman father, is in training to be a heroine, in hopes that life is like a gothic novel (her favorite is Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho). As her life experiences unfold, she realizes she's an ordinary young lady, after all. Illustration at right, entitled, "Catherine scaring herself with Udolpho" is from the 1833 edition. Favorite quote: “Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it.”\n\n\tChapter 1\n\n\tChapter 2\n\n\tChapter 3\n\n\tChapter 4\n\n\tChapter 5\n\n\tChapter 6\n\n\tChapter 7\n\n\tChapter 8\n\n\tChapter 9\n\n\tChapter 10\n\n\tChapter 11\n\n\tChapter 12\n\n\tChapter 13\n\n\tChapter 14\n\n\tChapter 15\n\n\tChapter 16\n\n\tChapter 17\n\n\tChapter 18\n\n\tChapter 19\n\n\tChapter 20\n\n\tChapter 21\n\n\tChapter 22\n\n\tChapter 23\n\n\tChapter 24\n\n\tChapter 25\n\n\tChapter 26\n\n\tChapter 27\n\n\tChapter 28\n\n\tChapter 29\n\n\tChapter 30\n\n\tChapter 31\n\n\tReturn to the Jane Austen library.
