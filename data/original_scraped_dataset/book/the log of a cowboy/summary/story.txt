Widely considered the most authentic narrative of cowboy life ever written, The Log of a Cowboy follows the passage of Tommy Moore, a young cowboy helping to drive three thousand circle-dot longhorns along the Great Western Cattle Trail from Brownsville, Texas to Montana in 1882. The book is based on author Andy Adams' experiences on the trail. He wrote The Log of a Cowboy as a response to the unrealistic cowboy stories that were being written at that time in American history. The Log of a Cowboy is a compelling American classic, first published in 1903, and continues to be reprinted due to its enduring popularity. Readers with an interest in the Old West will appreciate this book's historical account celebrating the American cowboy.
