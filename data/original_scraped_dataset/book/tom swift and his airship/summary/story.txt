Tom Swift and His Airship; or, The Stirring Cruise of the Red Cloud (1910) was particularly popular leading up to the Great War, part of the popular juvenile science fiction and adventure series in which the main character creates amazing wartime inventions to save the day. In this story, Tom invents an innovative airship that is half dirigible, half bi-plane, featuring an outlandish gondola with a kitchen, engine room and observation room. His father, Barton Swift, also an inventor, designs what will be the world's most advanced submarine. These books were great escapes from the realities of fear and loss during the War.\n\n\tChapter 1 - An Explosion\n\n\tChapter 2 - Ned Sees Mysterious Men\n\n\tChapter 3 - Whitewashed\n\n\tChapter 4 - A Trial Trip\n\n\tChapter 5 - Colliding With a Tower\n\n\tChapter 6 - Getting Off the Roof\n\n\tChapter 7 - Andy Tries a Trick\n\n\tChapter 8 - Winning a Prize\n\n\tChapter 9 - The Runaway Auto\n\n\tChapter 10 - A Bag of Tools\n\n\tChapter 11 - The Red Cloud Departs\n\n\tChapter 12 - Some Startling News\n\n\tChapter 13 - Mr. Damon In Danger\n\n\tChapter 14 - Andy Gives the Clue\n\n\tChapter 15 - Fired Upon\n\n\tChapter 16 - Over a Fiery Furnace\n\n\tChapter 17 - "Wanted for Robbery!"\n\n\tChapter 18 - Back for Vindication\n\n\tChapter 19 - Wrecked\n\n\tChapter 20 - Tom Gets a Clue\n\n\tChapter 21 - On the Trail\n\n\tChapter 22 - The Sheriff On Board\n\n\tChapter 23 - On To The Camp\n\n\tChapter 24 - The Raid\n\n\tChapter 25 - Andy Gets His Reward\n\n\tReturn to the Victor Appleton library.
