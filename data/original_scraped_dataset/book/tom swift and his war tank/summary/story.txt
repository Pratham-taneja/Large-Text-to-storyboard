Tom Swift and His War Tank; or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (1918) was published towards the end of the Great War and was part of the popular juvenile science fiction and adventure series in which the main character creates amazing wartime inventions to save the day. The British Army first deployed tanks on the Western Front during World War I, and in this story, Tom invents a bigger, faster tank (12 mph), able to bridge wider trenches than existing models. Tom Swift books provided hope and a happy ending during a time of fear and loss during the War.\n\n\tFeatured in our collection of World War I Literature and Books for Young Readers\n\n\tChapter I - Past Memories\n\n\tChapter II - Tom's Indifference\n\n\tChapter III - Ned Is Worried\n\n\tChapter IV - Queer Doings\n\n\tChapter V - "Is He A Slacker?"\n\n\tChapter VI - Seeing Things\n\n\tChapter VII - Up A Tree\n\n\tChapter VIII - Detective Rad\n\n\tChapter IX - A Night Test\n\n\tChapter X - A Runaway Giant\n\n\tChapter XI - Tom's Tank\n\n\tChapter XII - Bridging a Gap\n\n\tChapter XIII - Into a Trench\n\n\tChapter XIV - The Ruined Factory\n\n\tChapter XV - Across Country\n\n\tChapter XVI - The Old Barn\n\n\tChapter XVII - Veiled Threats\n\n\tChapter XVIII - Ready for France\n\n\tChapter XIX - Tom Is Missing\n\n\tChapter XX - The Search\n\n\tChapter XXI - A Prisoner\n\n\tChapter XXII - Rescued\n\n\tChapter XXIII - Gone\n\n\tChapter XXIV - Camouflaged\n\n\tChapter XXV - Foiled\n\n\tReturn to the Victor Appleton library.
