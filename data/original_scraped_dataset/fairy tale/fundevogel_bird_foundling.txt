There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and ashe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child werethere.

He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and atthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallenasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it inher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.

The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself,"Thou wilt take him home with thee, and bring him up with thy Lina." Hetook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together.

The one,however, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, becausea bird had carried it away.

Fundevogel and Lina loved each other sodearly that when they did not see each other they were sad.

The forester, however, had an old cook, who one evening took two pailsand began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, outto the spring.

Lina saw this and said, "Hark you, old Sanna, why are youfetching so much water?" "If thou wilt never repeat it to anyone, I willtell thee why." So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,and then the cook said, "Early to-morrow morning, when the forester isout hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle,I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it." Betimes next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and whenhe was gone the children were still in bed.

Then Lina said to Fundevogel,"If thou wilt never leave me, I too will never leave thee." Fundevogelsaid, "Neither now, nor ever will I leave thee." Then said Lina, "ThenI will tell thee.

Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of waterinto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said thatif I would promise not to tell any one she would tell me, and I saidI would be sure not to tell any one, and she said that early to-morrowmorning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full ofwater, throw thee into it and boil thee; but we will get up quickly,dress ourselves, and go away together." The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and wentaway.

When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into thebed-room to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it.

But when she camein, and went to the beds, both the children were gone.

Then she wasterribly alarmed, and she said to herself, "What shall I say now whenthe forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They mustbe followed instantly to get them back again." Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run andovertake the children.

The children, however, were sitting outsidethe forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running,Lina said to Fundevogel, "Never leave me, and I will never leavethee." Fundevogel said, "Neither now, nor ever." Then said Lina,"Do thou become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it." When the threeservants came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree andone rose on it, but the children were nowhere.

Then said they, "Thereis nothing to be done here," and they went home and told the cook thatthey had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one roseon it.

Then the old cook scolded and said, "You simpletons, you shouldhave cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and broughtit home with you; go, and do it once." They had therefore to go out andlook for the second time.

The children, however, saw them coming from adistance.

Then Lina said, "Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will neverleave thee." Fundevogel said, "Neither now, nor ever." Said Lina, "Thendo thou become a church, and I'll be the chandelier in it." So when thethree servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelierin it.

They said therefore to each other, "What can we do here, let usgo home." When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and that there wasa chandelier in it.

And the cook scolded them and said, "You fools! whydid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier homewith you?" And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went withthe three servants in pursuit of the children.

The children, however,saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddlingafter them.

Then said Lina, "Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will neverleave thee." Then said Fundevogel, "Neither now, nor ever." Said Lina,"Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it." The cook, however,came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and wasabout to drink it up.

But the duck swam quickly to her, seized her headin its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old witch had todrown.

Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted,and if they are not dead, they are living still.
