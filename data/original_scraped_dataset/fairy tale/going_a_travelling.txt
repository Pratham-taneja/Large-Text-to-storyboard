There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel,but his mother said, "How canst thou travel? We have no money at allfor thee to take away with thee." Then said the son, "I will manage verywell for myself; I will always say, Not much, not much, not much." So he walked for a long time and always said, "Not much, not much,not much." Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, "Godspeed you! not much, not much, not much." "What sayst thou churl, 'notmuch?"' And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish.

Soone of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, "Hast thou neverseen me threshing?" "What ought I to say, then?" asked the youth.

"Thoumust say, 'Get it full, get it full.'" After this he again walked a longtime, and said, "Get it full, get it full," until he came to the gallows,where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang.

Thensaid he, "Good morning; get it full, get it full." "What sayst thou,knave, get it full? Dost thou want to make out that there are still morewicked people in the world is not this enough?" And he again got someblows on his back.

"What am I to say, then?" said he.

"Thou must say,may God have pity on the poor soul." Again the youth walked on for a long while and said, "May God have pityon the poor soul!" Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker whowas cutting up a horse.

The youth said, "Good morning; God have pityon the poor soul!" "What dost thou say, thou ill-tempered knave?" andthe knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see outof his eyes.

"What am I to say, then?" "Thou must say, 'There lies thecarrion in the pit!'" So he walked on, and always said, "There lies the carrion in the pit,there lies the carrion in the pit." And he came to a cart full of people,so he said, "Good morning, there lies the carrion in the pit!" Then thecart pushed him into a hole, and the driver took his whip and crackedit upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother,and as long as he lived he never went out a-travelling again.
