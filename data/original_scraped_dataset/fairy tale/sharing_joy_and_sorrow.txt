There was once a tailor, who was a quarrelsome fellow, and his wife,who was good, industrious, and pious, never could please him.

Whatevershe did, he was not satisfied, but grumbled and scolded, and knockedher about and beat her.

As the authorities at last heard of it, they hadhim summoned, and put in prison in order to make him better.

He was keptfor a while on bread and water, and then set free again.

He was forced,however, to promise not to beat his wife any more, but to live with herin peace, and share joy and sorrow with her, as married people ought todo.

All went on well for a time, but then he fell into his old ways, andwas surly and quarrelsome.

And because he dared not beat her, he wouldseize her by the hair and tear it out.

The woman escaped from him, andsprang out into the yard, but he ran after her with his yard-measure andscissors, and chased her about, and threw the yard-measure and scissorsat her, and whatever else came his way.

When he hit her he laughed,and when he missed her, he stormed and swore.

This went on so longthat the neighbors came to the wife's assistance.

The tailor was againsummoned before the magistrates, and reminded of his promise.

"Deargentlemen," said he, "I have kept my word, I have not beaten her, buthave shared joy and sorrow with her." "How can that be," said the judge,"when she continually brings such heavy complaints against you?" "I havenot beaten her, but just because she looked so strange I wanted to combher hair with my hand; she, however, got away from me, and left me quitespitefully.

Then I hurried after her, and in order to bring her back toher duty, I threw at her as a well-meant admonition whatever came readilyto hand.

I have shared joy and sorrow with her also, for whenever I hither I was full of joy, and she of sorrow, and if I missed her, then shewas joyful, and I sorry." The judges were not satisfied with this answer,but gave him the reward he deserved.
