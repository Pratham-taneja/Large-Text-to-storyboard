First Story.

There was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon asmall bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated herself in the yardwith it.

When she began to eat however, a snake came creeping out of acrevice in the wall, dipped its little head in the dish, and ate withher.

The child had pleasure in this, and when she was sitting there withher little dish and the snake did not come at once, she cried,  "Snake, snake, come swiftlyHither come, thou tiny thing,  Thou shalt have thy crumbs of bread,Thou shalt refresh thyself with milk." Then the snake came in haste, and enjoyed its food.

Moreover it showedgratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty things from itshidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden playthings.

The snake,however, only drank the milk, and left the bread-crumbs alone.

Then oneday the child took its little spoon and struck the snake gently on itshead with it, and said, "Eat the bread-crumbs as well, little thing." Themother, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the child talking tosomeone, and when she saw that she was striking a snake with her spoon,ran out with a log of wood, and killed the good little creature.

From that time forth, a change came over the child.

As long as the snakehad eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but now she lost herpretty rosy cheeks and wasted away.

It was not long before the funeralbird began to cry in the night, and the redbreast to collect littlebranches and leaves for a funeral garland, and soon afterwards the childlay on her bier.

Second Story.

An orphan child was sitting on the town walls spinning, when she sawa snake coming out of a hole low down in the wall.

Swiftly she spreadout beside this one of the blue silk handkerchiefs which snakes havesuch a strong liking for, and which are the only things they willcreep on.

As soon as the snake saw it, it went back, then returned,bringing with it a small golden crown, laid it on the handkerchief,and then went away again.

The girl took up the crown, it glittered andwas of delicate golden filagree work.

It was not long before the snakecame back for the second time, but when it no longer saw the crown, itcrept up to the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against itas long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there dead.

Ifthe girl had but left the crown where it was, the snake would certainlyhave brought still more of its treasures out of the hole.
