There was once an old woman, but thou hast surely seen an old womango a-begging before now? This woman begged likewise, and when she gotanything she said, "May God reward you." The beggar-woman came to a door,and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warminghimself.

The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standingshivering thus by the door, "Come, old mother, and warm yourself." Shecame in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began toburn, and she was not aware of it.

The boy stood and saw that, but heought to have put the flames out.

Is it not true that he ought to haveput them out? And if he had not any water, then should he have wept allthe water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied twopretty streams with which to extinguish them.
