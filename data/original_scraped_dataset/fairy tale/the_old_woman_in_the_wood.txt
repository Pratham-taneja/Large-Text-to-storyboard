A poor servant-girl was once travelling with the family with which shewas in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the midstof it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they found.

Allperished together except the girl, who had jumped out of the carriagein a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree.

When the robbers had goneaway with their booty, she came out and beheld the great disaster.

Thenshe began to weep bitterly, and said, "What can a poor girl like me donow? I do not know how to get out of the forest, no human being lives init, so I must certainly starve." She walked about and looked for a road,but could find none.

When it was evening she seated herself under a tree,gave herself into God's keeping, and resolved to sit waiting there andnot go away, let what might happen.

When, however, she had sat therefor a while, a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key inits mouth.

It put the little key in her hand, and said, "Dost thou seethat great tree, therein is a little lock, it opens with the tiny key,and there thou wilt find food enough, and suffer no more hunger." Thenshe went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little dish,and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her fill.

Whenshe was satisfied, she said, "It is now the time when the hens at home goto roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too." Then the dove flew to heragain, and brought another golden key in its bill, and said, "Open thattree there, and thou willt find a bed." So she opened it, and found abeautiful white bed, and she prayed God to protect her during the night,and lay down and slept.

In the morning the dove came for the third time,and again brought a little key, and said, "Open that tree there, and thouwilt find clothes." And when she opened it, she found garments beset withgold and with jewels, more splendid than those of any king's daughter.So she lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and providedher with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life.

Once, however, the dove came and said, "Wilt thou do something for mysake?" "With all my heart," said the girl.

Then said the little dove,"I will guide thee to a small house; enter it, and inside it, an oldwoman will be sitting by the fire and will say, 'Good-day.' But on thylife give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass by her onthe right side; further on, there is a door, which open, and thou wiltenter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds are lying,amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining stones; leave them,however, where they are, and seek out a plain one, which must likewisebe amongst them, and bring it here to me as quickly as thou canst." Thegirl went to the little house, and came to the door.

There sat an oldwoman who stared when she saw her, and said, "Good-day my child." Thegirl gave her no answer, and opened the door.

"Whither away," cried theold woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to hold her fast,saying, "That is my house; no one can go in there if I choose not toallow it." But the girl was silent, got away from her, and went straightinto the room.

Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings,which gleamed and glittered before her eyes.

She turned them over andlooked for the plain one, but could not find it.

While she was seeking,she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and wanting to getoff with a bird-cage which she had in her hand.

So she went after herand took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised it up and lookedinto it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill.

Thenshe took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and thought thelittle white dove would come and get the ring, but it did not.

Then sheleant against a tree and determined to wait for the dove, and, as shethus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant, and wasletting its branches down.

And suddenly the branches twined around her,and were two arms, and when she looked round, the tree was a handsome man,who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said, "Thou hast delivered mefrom the power of the old woman, who is a wicked witch.

She had changedme into a tree, and every day for two hours I was a white dove, and solong as she possessed the ring I could not regain my human form." Thenhis servants and his horses, who had likewise been changed into trees,were freed from the enchantment also, and stood beside him.

And he ledthem forth to his kingdom, for he was a King's son, and they married,and lived happily.
