EAST INDIA was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until hehad received six hundred dollars.

Then the townsfolk caused it to beproclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the moneyshould be burgomaster.

Now there was a poor fisherman who fished on thelake with his son, and the enemy came and took the son prisoner, and gavethe father six hundred dollars for him.

So the father went and gave themto the great men of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fishermanbecame burgomaster.

Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say,"Mr.

Burgomaster," should be put to death on the gallows.

The son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great forest on ahigh mountain.

The mountain opened, and he went into a great enchantedcastle, wherein chairs, tables, and benches were all hung with black.

Thencame three young princesses who were entirely dressed in black, but hada little white on their faces; they told him he was not to be afraid,they would not hurt him, and that he could deliver them.

He said hewould gladly do that, if he did but know how.

At this, they told him hemust for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them, andwhat he wanted to have he was just to ask for, and if they dared givehim an answer they would do so.

When he had been there for a long whilehe said he should like to go to his father, and they told him he mightgo.

He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this coat,and in a week he must be back there again.

Then he was caught up, and was instantly in East India.

He could nolonger find his father in the fisherman's hut, and asked the people wherethe poor fisherman could be, and they told him he must not say that,or he would come to the gallows.

Then he went to his father and said,"Fisherman, how hast thou got here?" Then the father said, "Thou mustnot say that, if the great men of the town knew of that, thou wouldstcome to the gallows." He, however, would not stop, and was brought to thegallows.

When he was there, he said, "O, my masters, just give me leaveto go to the old fisherman's hut." Then he put on his old smock-frock,and came back to the great men, and said, "Do ye not now see? Am I notthe son of the poor fisherman? Did I not earn bread for my father andmother in this dress?" Hereupon his father knew him again, and beggedhis pardon, and took him home with him, and then he related all that hadhappened to him, and how he had got into a forest on a high mountain,and the mountain had opened and he had gone into an enchanted castle,where all was black, and three young princesses had come to him whowere black except a little white on their faces.

And they had told himnot to fear, and that he could deliver them.

Then his mother said thatmight very likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to takea holy-water vessel with him, and drop some boiling water on their faces.

He went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped the water ontheir faces as they were sleeping, and they all turned half-white.

Thenall the three princesses sprang up, and said, "Thou accursed dog, ourblood shall cry for vengeance on thee! Now there is no man born in theworld, nor will any ever be born who can set us free! We have stillthree brothers who are bound by seven chains they shall tear thee topieces." Then there was a loud shrieking all over the castle, and hesprang out of the window, and broke his leg, and the castle sank intothe earth again, the mountain shut to again, and no one knew where thecastle had stood.
