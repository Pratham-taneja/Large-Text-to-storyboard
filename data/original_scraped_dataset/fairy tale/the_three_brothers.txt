There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the worldbut the house in which he lived.

Now each of the sons wished to havethe house after his father's death; but the father loved them all alike,and did not know what to do; he did not wish to sell the house, becauseit had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided the moneyamongst them.

At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons,"Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a trade, and, when youall come back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house." The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be ablacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master.

Theyfixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each wenthis way.

It chanced that they all found skilful masters, who taught them theirtrades well.

The blacksmith had to shoe the King's horses, and hethought to himself, "The house is mine, without doubt." The barberonly shaved great people, and he too already looked upon the house ashis own.

The fencing-master got many a blow, but he only bit his lip,and let nothing vex him; "for," said he to himself, "If you are afraidof a blow, you'll never win the house." When the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back hometo their father; but they did not know how to find the best opportunityfor showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together.

As theywere sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the field.

"Ah,ha, just in time!" said the barber.

So he took his basin and soap, andlathered away until the hare came up; then he soaped and shaved off thehare's whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed, and didnot even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body.

"Well done!" saidthe old man.

"Your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully,or the house will be yours." Soon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at fullspeed.

"Now you shall see what I can do, father," said the blacksmith;so away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of one ofthe horses whilst he was galloping, and put him on four new shoes withoutstopping him.

"You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother,"said his father; "I do not know to which I ought to give the house." Then the third son said, "Father, let me have my turn, if you please;"and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished itbackwards and forwards above his head so fast that not a drop fell uponhim.

It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down intorrents; but he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and remainedas dry as if he were sitting in a house.

When his father saw this hewas amazed, and said, "This is the master-piece, the house is yours!" His brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand; and,as they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together inthe house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so welland were so clever, they earned a great deal of money.

Thus they livedtogether happily until they grew old; and at last, when one of themfell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely about it that theyalso fell ill, and soon after died.

And because they had been so clever,and had loved one another so much, they were all laid in the same grave.
