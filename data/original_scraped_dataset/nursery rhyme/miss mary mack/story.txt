Miss Mary Mack is one of the most popular English-language clapping games for children. Parents, it's time to remember, and share it with your children! A great way to combine learning-to-read and kinesthetic activity, including jump-roping and clapping the lyrics.\n\n\tIf your children enjoyed this song, they may also like the counting song, Five Little Speckled Frogs.
