Simple Simon met a pieman,
Going to the fair;
 
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
"Let me taste your ware."
Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
"Show me first your penny."
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
"Indeed I have not any."
 
Simple Simon went a-fishing
For to catch a whale:
All the water he had got
Was in his mother's pail.\n\n\t4.3
