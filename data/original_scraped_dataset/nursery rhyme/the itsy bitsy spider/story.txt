Lyrics and finger play instructions:\n\n\tThe itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout [alternately touch the thumb of one hand to the index finger of the other]
Down came the rain [with both hands held high, wiggle and move downward to mimic rain falling]
and washed the spider out [sweep the hands from side to side and make a "swoosh" noise]
Out came the sun [raise both hands above head and touch to form a circle for the sun]
and dried up all the rain [wiggle fingers and move upwards]
and the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again. [alternately touch the thumb of one hand to index finger of the other]


Featured in our Pre-K Wordplay! to inspire beginner readers. For another motion-song, enjoy Pumpkins in the Cornfield.
