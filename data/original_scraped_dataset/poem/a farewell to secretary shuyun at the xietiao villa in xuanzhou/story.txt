Since yesterday had to throw me and bolt, Today has hurt my heart even more. The autumn wild geese have a long wind for escort As I face them from this villa, drinking my wine. The bones of great writers are your brushes, in the School of Heaven, And I am a Lesser Xie growing up by your side. We both are exalted to distant thought, Aspiring to the sky and the bright moon. But since water still flows, though we cut it with our swords, And sorrows return, though we drown them with wine, Since the world can in no way answer our craving, I will loosen my hair tomorrow and take to a fishing boat.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . .
