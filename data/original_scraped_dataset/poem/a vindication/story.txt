If heaven loved not the wine, A Wine Star would not be in heaven; If earth loved not the wine, The Wine Spring would not be on the earth. Since heaven and earth love the wine, Need a tippling mortal be ashamed? The transparent wine, I hear, Has the soothing virtue of a sage, While the turgid is rich, they say, As the fertile mind of the wise. Both the sage and the wise were drinkers, Why seek for peers among gods and goblins? Three cups open the grand door to bliss; Take a jugful, the universe is yours. Such is the rapture of the wine, That the sober shall never inherit.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . . Read the next poem; Ballads of Four Seasons: Spring
