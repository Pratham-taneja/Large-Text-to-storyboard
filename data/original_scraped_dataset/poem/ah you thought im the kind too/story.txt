Ah! You thought I'm the kind too, To cry 'how could you forget me', And praying and sobbing, throw myself Under the horses' hooves.  Or that I'd ask the sorceress For some enchanted root in water, And send you a fatal gift – My secretly-scented handkerchief.  I'd rather be damned. Not a look or sigh Will reach your accursed soul, But I swear by the angelic garden, I swear by the miraculous icon, And by our nights of fiery passion – I'll never return to you.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; 'All I see is hilly Pavlovsk,'
