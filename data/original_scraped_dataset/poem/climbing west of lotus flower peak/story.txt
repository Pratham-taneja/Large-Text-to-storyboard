Amongst the grandeur of Hua Shan I climb to the Flower Peak, and fancy I see fairies and immortals carrying lotus in their sacred white hands, robes flowing they fly filling the sky with colour as they rise to the palace of heaven, inviting me to go to the cloud stage and see Wei Shu-ching, guardian angel of Hua Shan; so dreamily I go with them riding to the sky on the back of wild geese which call as they fly, but when we look below at Loyang, not so clear because of the mist, everywhere could be seen looting armies, which took Loyang, creating chaos and madness with blood flowing everywhere; like animals of prey rebel army men made into officials with caps and robes to match.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . .
