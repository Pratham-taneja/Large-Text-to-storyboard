As down Mount Emerald at eve I came, The mountain moon went all the way with me. Backward I looked, to see the heights aflame With a pale light that glimmered eerily.  A little lad undid the rustic latch As hand in hand your cottage we did gain, Where green limp tendrils at our cloaks did catch, And dim bamboos o'erhung a shadowy lane.  Gaily I cried, "Here may we rest our fill!" Then choicest wines we quaffed; and cheerily "The Wind among the Pines" we sang, until A few faint stars hung in the Galaxy.  Merry were you, my friend: and drunk was I, Blissfully letting all the world go by.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . . Read the next poem; Down Zhongnan Mountain
