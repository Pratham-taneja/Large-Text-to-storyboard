Jade carved dishes - food costing more. I throw the chopsticks down, Food and wine are tasteless. Draw my magic sword, Mind confused stare round me. See the ice floes block the Yellow River. Feel the snowfall shroud the Tâai-hang Mountains. Quiet again I cast in dark waters, Find the fragile boat that might drift sunwards. Hard Journey. So many side-tracks. Turn after turn, and where am I? New breezes flatten down the waves ahead. I'll set cloud sails, cross the Blue Horizon.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . .
