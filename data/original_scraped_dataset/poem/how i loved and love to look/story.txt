How I loved, and love, to look At your chained shores, At the balconies on which centuries Never set foot. And you are truly the capital, For we who are mad and luminous; But when those pure and special hours Linger above the Neva, And the wind in May sweeps round The columns that edge the water, You are like a sinner seeing, before death, A sweetest dream of paradise.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; 'I asked the cuckoo'
