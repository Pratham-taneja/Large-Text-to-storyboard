I came here, in idleness. Where I'm bored: all the same to me! A sleepy hilltop mill, yes, Here years pass silently.  Over convolvulus gone dry The bee swims past, ahead, I call to that mermaid by The pond: the mermaid's dead.  Thick with mud, and rusted, The wide pond's shallows: Over the trembling aspen A weightless moon glows.  Isee everything freshly. The poplars smell moist. I'm silent. Silent, ready To be yours again, earth.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; 'Ice, resonant, floats by,'
