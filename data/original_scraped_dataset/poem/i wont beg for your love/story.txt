I won't beg for your love. It's safely laid aside…. I won't be penning jealous Letters to your bride. But be wise, take my advice: Give her my poems to read, Give her my photos beside – Be kind to the newly-wed! Oh, knowledge is better for geese, Feeling they've won completely, Than sweet companionable speech, Or a tender first-night memory… And when you've spent all your Kopecks of joy with your dear friend, And your spirit's sated with it all, And suddenly you're ashamed – Don't come – I'll fail to know you – To me, night's crestfallen guest. For how could I help you? I've no cure for happiness.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; Legend on An Unfinished Portrait
