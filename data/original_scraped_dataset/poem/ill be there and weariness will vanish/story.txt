I'll be there and weariness will vanish.
The cold of early morning will please.
There are villages, mysterious and dark –
Storehouses of immortal labour.

My calm and trusting love
Of that place will never be vanquished.
There's a drop of Novgorod blood
In me – a sliver of ice in foaming wine.

And that can never be altered,
It's un-melted by great heat,
And no matter what I may praise –
You shine quietly before me.\n\n\t3
