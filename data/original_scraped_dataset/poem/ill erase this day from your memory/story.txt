I'll erase this day from your memory, So your vague helpless gaze will ask Where you saw Persian lilac, Swallows, and this wooden house.  Oh, how often you'll remember The sudden pain of unnamed longing, And in townships seek in dream For a street that isn't on the map!  At the sight of every chance letter, When a voice sounds from an open door, You'll think: 'It's she, who's here Bringing help to the non-believer.'\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
