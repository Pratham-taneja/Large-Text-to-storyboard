Oh, there's no reason for sighs, Sadness is pointless, a crime, Here, from grey canvas, I rise, Vaguely, strangely through time.  Arms lifted, freely curtailed, A tormented smile on my face, I was forced to become like this Through hours of mutual grace.  He wished it so, he willed it so, With words, spiteful and dead. Anxiety clotted my mouth: oh, My cheeks with snow were wed.  It's no sin of his, it seems, Other eyes, he left to see, No matter these empty dreams Of my mortal lethargy.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
