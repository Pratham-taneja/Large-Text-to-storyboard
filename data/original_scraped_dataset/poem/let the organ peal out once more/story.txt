Let the organ peal out once more, Like a first spring thunderstorm; From behind your bride's shoulder, My half-closed eyes will gaze.  Farewell, goodbye, be happy my friend, Ireturn you your sweet vow, But don't let your passionate one See my inimitable ravings –  That would inject a burning venom Into your blessed, joyful union… And I go to claim a marvellous garden Where grass rustles, the Muse declaims.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; "Like a White Stone"
