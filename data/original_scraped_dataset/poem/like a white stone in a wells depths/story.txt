Like a white stone in a well's depths,
A single memory remains to me,
That I can't, won't fight against:
It's happiness â€“ and misery.

Ithink someone who gazed full
In my eyes, would see it straight.
They'd be sad, be thoughtful,
As if hearing a mournful tale.

I know the gods changed people
To things, yet left consciousness free.
To keep suffering's wonder alive,
In memory, you changed into me.\n\n\t5.3
