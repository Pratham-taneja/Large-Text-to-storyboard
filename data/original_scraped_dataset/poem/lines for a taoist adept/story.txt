My friend lives high on East Mountain. His nature is to love the hills and gorges. In green spring he sleeps in empty woodland, Still there when the noon sun brightens. Pine-tree winds to dust his hair. Rock-filled streams to cleanse his senses. Free of all sound and stress, Resting on a wedge of cloud and mist.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . . Read the next poem; Listening to a Flute in Yellow Crane Pavillion
