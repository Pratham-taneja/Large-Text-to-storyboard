A snake, it coils Bewitching the heart. Day after day, coos A dove on the white sill.  A bright flash in frost, Drowsy night-scented stockâ€¦ Yet, sure and secret, It's far from peace and joy.  It knows how to weep sweetly In the violin's yearning prayer; And is fearfully divined In a stranger's smile.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; 'Memory of sun ebbs from the heart.'
