My heart beats smoothly, steadily,
What are long years to me?
Under the Galernaya arch,
Our shadows, for eternity.

Through half-closed eyelids,
I see, I see that you're with me,
And forever held in your hand
Is my unopened fan.

Because we stood together,
In that blessed miraculous moment,
The instant of the rose-red moon
Lifting over the Summer Garden –

I've no need to wait
At some hateful window,
Or grow weary with meeting –
My thirsty love is quenched.

You are free, and so am I,
Tomorrow will be better than yesterday –
Above the Neva's dark waters,
Below the Emperor Peter's
Cold smile.\n\n\t6.5
