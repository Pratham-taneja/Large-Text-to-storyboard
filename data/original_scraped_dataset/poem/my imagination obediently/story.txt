My imagination, obediently, Conceives grey eyes. In Tver, in my solitude, It's you I bitterly remember.  Happily captive in another's arms, On the left bank of the Neva, My famed contemporary, You have all that you desired;  You who told me: Enough, Go now, quench your love! And I weakly, waste away, Though the blood beats more strongly.  If I die, who will write, These poems to you, Whose voice will ring With my still unspoken words?\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . . Read the next poem; 'My voice is weak, but not my will'
