Give me comfortless seasons of sickness, Visitations of wrath and of wrong On my house; Lord, take child and companion, And destroy the sweet power of song.  Thus I pray at each matins, each vespers, After these many wearying days, That the storm-cloud which broods over Russia May be changed to a nimbus ablaze.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
