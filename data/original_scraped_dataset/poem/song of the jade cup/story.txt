A jade cup was broken because old age came too soon to give fulfilment to hopes; after drinking three cups of wine I wiped my sword and started to dance under an autumn moon first singing in a high voice then unable to halt tears coming; I remember the day when first I was summoned to court and I was feasted splendidly writing poems in praise of the Emperor, making jokes with officials around several times changing my horse, taking the best from the imperial stables; with my whip studded with jade and coral presented to me by the Emperor, my life was free and easy, people calling me the "Banished Immortal." Hsi Shih was good at smiling as well as frowning, useless for ordinary girls to try and imitate her. Surely it was only her loveliness the king adored, but unfortunately jealousy within the palace led to her death.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Li Bai library , or . . .
