My heart was chilled and numb, But my feet were light. I fumbled the glove for my left hand Onto my right.  It seemed there were many steps, I knew â€“ there were only three. Autumn, whispering in the maples, Kept urging: 'Die with me!  I'm cheated by joylessness, Changed by a destiny untrue.' I answered: 'My dear, my dear! I too: I'll die with you.'  The song of the last meeting. I see that dark house again. Only bedroom candles burning, With a yellow, indifferent, flame.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
