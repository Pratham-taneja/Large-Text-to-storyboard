A pity it is evening, yet
I do love the water of this spring
seeing how clear it is, how clean;
rays of sunset gleam on it,
lighting up its ripples, making it
one with those who travel
the roads; I turn and face
the moon; sing it a song, then
listen to the sound of the wind
amongst the pines.\n\n\tIllustration by Yamamoto Shunkyo, Spring of Mountain, 1933\n\n\t8.7
