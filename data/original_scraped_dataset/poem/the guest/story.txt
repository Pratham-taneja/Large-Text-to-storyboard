All's as it was: the snowstorm's Fine flakes wet the window pane, And I myself am not new-born, But a man came to me today.  I asked: 'What do you wish?' He said: 'To be with you in hell'. Ilaughed: 'Ah, sadly, No: perhaps you wish me ill.'  But, his dry hand touched A petal with a light caress: 'Tell me, how they kiss you, Tell me, how you kiss.'  And his eyes, dully gazing, Never lifted from my ring. Not a single muscle shifting Beneath that evil-glistening.  O, I understand: to know, passionately And intensely, is his delight, That there's nothing that he needs, And nothing I can deny.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
