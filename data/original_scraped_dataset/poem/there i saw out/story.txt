There I saw out My twenty-first year, Sweet in the mouth The dark, sultry honey.  On the twigs I tore My white silk dress, In the bowed pine, The nightingale never rested.

Swiftly climbing the hill, Swimming over the river, Yes, and later, Don't tell: leave me be.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
