For Nikolai Nedobrovo  There's a secret border in human closeness, That love's being, love's passion, cannot pass – Though lips are sealed together in dreadful silence, Though hearts break in two with love's distress.  And friendship too is powerless, and years Of sublime flame-filled happiness, When the soul itself is free, a stranger, To the slow languor of sensuality.  Those who try to reach that boundary are mad, And those who have – are filled with anguish. Now you know, now you understand, Why my heart won't beat at your caress.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library , or . . .
