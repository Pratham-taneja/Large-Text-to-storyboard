Yes, I loved those nocturnal gatherings -
The iced glasses on the little table,
A fine steam from the black, fragrant coffee,
The red fire roaring, the winter heat,
The laughter at caustic literary jokes,
And a stranger's gaze, helpless and dreadful.\n\n\t4














 Add  'Yes, I loved those nocturnal gatherings - ' to your library.
