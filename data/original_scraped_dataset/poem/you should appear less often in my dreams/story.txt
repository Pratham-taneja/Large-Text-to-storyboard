You should appear less often in my dreams, Since we meet so frequently; Yet only in night's sanctuary Are you sad, troubled, and tender. And sweeter than seraphic praise Is your lips' dear flatteryâ€¦ Ah, in dreams you won't mistake my name, Or gently sigh, as you do here.\n\n\tThis poem is featured in our selection of 100 Great Poems.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Anna Akhmatova library
