TO look at old Sam Gates you would never sus-
pect him of having nei-ves. His sixty-nine
years of close application to the needs of the
soil had given him a certain earthy stolidity. To ob-
serve him hoeing, or thinning out a broad field of tur-
nips, hardly attracted one's attention. He seemed so
much part and parcel of the whole scheme. He
blended into the soil like a glorified swede. Neverthe-
less, the half-dozen people who claimed his acquaintance
knew him to be a man who suffered from little moods
of irritability.\n\n\tAnd on this glorious morning a little incident an-
noyed him unreasonably. It concerned his niece Ag-
gie. She was a plump girl with clear blue eyes and a
face as round and inexpressive as the dumplings for
which the county was famous. She came slowly across
the long sweep of the downland and putting down the
bundle wrapped up in a red handkerchief which con-
tained his breakfast and dinner, she said:\n\n\t" Well, uncle, is there any noos ? "\n\n\tNow this may not appear to the casual reader to be a
remark likely to cause irritation, but it affected old
Sam Gates as a very silly and unnecessary question.
It was moreover the constant repetition of it which was beginning to anger him. He met his niece twice a day.
In the morning she brought his bundle of food at seven,
and when he passed his sister's cottage on the way home
to tea at five she was invariably hanging about the gate.
And on each occasion she always said, in exactly the
same voice:\n\n\t" Well, uncle, is there any noos ? "\n\n\t" Noos " ! What " noos " should there be ? For
sixty-nine years he had never lived further than five
miles from Halvesham. For nearly sixty of those
years he had bent his back above the soil. There were
indeed historic occasions: once, for instance, when he
had married Annie Hachet. And there was the birth
of his daughter. There was also a famous occasion
when he had visited London. Once he had been to a
flower-show at Market Roughborough. He either went
or didn't go to church on Sundays. He had had many
interesting chats with Mr. James at " The Cowman,"
and three years ago had sold a pig to Mrs. Waig. But
he couldn't always have interesting " noos " of this sort
up his sleeve. Didn't the silly gaffer know that for
the last three weeks he had been thinning out turnips
for Mr. Dodge on this very same field ? What " noos "
could there be?\n\n\tHe blinked at his niece, and didn't answer. She
undid the parcel, and said:\n\n\t" Mrs. Goping's fowl got out again last night."\n\n\tHe replied, " Ah ! " in a non-committal manner, and
began to munch his bread and bacon. His niece picked
up the handkerchief and humming to herself, walked\n\n\tback across the field. It was a glorious morning, and a
white sea-mist added to the promise of a hot day. He
sat there munching, thinking of nothing in particular,
but gradually subsiding into a mood of placid content.
He noticed the back of Aggie disappear in the distance.
It was a mile to the cottage, and a mile and a half to
Halvesham. Silly things, girls! They were all alike.
One had to make allowances. He dismissed her from
his thoughts and took a long swig of tea out of a bottle.
Insects buzzed lazily. He tapped his pocket to assure
himself that his pouch of shag was there, and then he
continued munching. When he had finished, he
lighted his pipe and stretched himself comfortably.
He looked along the line of turnips he had thinned,
and then across the adjoining field of swedes. Silver
streaks appeared on the sea below the mist. In some
dim way he felt happy in his solitude amidst this
sweeping immensity of earth and sea and sky.\n\n\tAnd then something else came to irritate him. It
was one of " these dratted airyplanes." " Airy-
planes " were his pet aversion. He could find nothing
to be said in their favor. Il^asty, noisy, vile-smelling
things that seared the heavens, and make the earth dan-
gerous. And every day there seemed to be more and
more of them. Of course " this old war " was respon-
sible for a lot of them, he knew. The war was " a
plaguey noosance." They were short-handed on the
farm. Beer and tobacco were dear, and Mrs. Stevens'
nephew had been and got wounded in the foot.\n\n\tHe turned his attention once more to the turnips.\n\n\tBut an " airyplane " has an annoying genius for grip-
ping one's attention. When it appears on the scene,
however much we dislike it, it has a way of taking
stage-center; we cannot help constantly looking at it.
And so it was with old Sam Gates. He spat on his
hands, and blinked up at the sky. And suddenly the
aeroplane behaved in a very extraordinary manner.
It was well over the sea when it seemed to lurch in a
drunken manner, and skimmed the water. Then it
shot up at a dangerous angle and zigzagged. It started
to go farther out, and then turned and made for the
land. The engines were making a curious grating
noise. It rose once more, and then suddenly dived
downwards and came plump down right in the middle
of Mr. Dodge's field of swedes !\n\n\tFinally, as if not content with this desecration, it
ran along the ground, ripping and tearing up twenty-
five yards of good swedes, and then came to a stop.
Old Sam Gates was in a terrible state. The aeroplane
was more than a hundred yards away, but he waved his
arms, and called out:\n\n\t" Hi ! you there, you mustn't land in they swedes !
They're Mister Dodge's."\n\n\tThe instant the aeroplane stopped a man leapt out,
and gazed quickly round. He glanced at Sam Gates,
and seemed uncertain whether to address him or
whether to concentrate his attention on the flying-ma-
chine. The latter arrangement appeared to be his ul-
timate decision. He dived under the engine, and be-
came frantically busy. Sam had never seen any one\n\n\twork with such furious energy. But all the same, it
was not to be tolerated. It was disgraceful. Sam
shouted out across the field, almost hurrying in his in-
dignation. When he approached within earshot of the
aviator, he cried out again:\n\n\t" Hi ! you mustn't rest your old airj'plane here.
You've kicked up all Mr. Dodge's swedes. A nice
thing you've done ! "\n\n\tHe was within five yards when suddenly the aviator
turned and covered him with a revolver! And, speak-
ing in a sharp, staccato voice, he said :\n\n\t" Old grandfather, you must sit down. I am very
occupied. If you interfere or attempt to go away, I
shoot you. So ! "\n\n\tSam gazed at the horrid glittering little barrel, and
gasped. Well, he never! To be threatened with mur-
der when you're doing your duty in your employer's
private property ! But, still, perhaps the man was
mad. A man must be more or less mad to go up in one
of those crazy things. And life was very sweet on
that summer morning, in spite of sixty-nine years. He
sat down among the swedes.\n\n\tThe aviator was so busy with his cranks and machin-
ery that he hardly deigned to pay him any attention,
except to keep the revolver handy. He worked fever-
ishlv, and Sam sat watching him. At the end of ten
minutes he seemed to have solved his troubles with the
machine, but he still seemed very scared. He kept on
glancing round and out to sea. When his repairs were
completed, he straightened his back and wiped the perspiration from his brow. He was apparently on
the point of springing back into the machine and going
off, when a sudden mood of facetiousness, caused by-
relief from the strain he had endured, came to him.
He turned to old Sam, and smiled; at the same time
remarking :\n\n\t"Well, old grandfather, and now we shall be all
right, isn't it?"\n\n\tHe came close up to Sam, and then suddenly started
back.\n\n\t" Gott ! " he cried. " Paul Jouperts ! "
Sam gazed at him, bewildered, and the madman
started talking to him in some foreign tongue. Sam
shook his head.\n\n\t" You no right," he remarked, " to come bargin'
through they swedes of Mr. Dodge's."\n\n\tAnd then the aviator behaved in a most peculiar man-
ner. He came up and examined his face very closely,
and gave a gentle tug at his beard and hair, as if to
see whether it were real or false.\n\n\t" What is your name, old man ? " he said.
" Sam Gates."\n\n\tThe aviator muttered some words that sounded some-
thing like " mare vudish ! " and then turned to his ma-
chine. He appeared to be dazed and in a great state of
doubt. He fumbled with some cranks, but kept glanc-
ing at old Sam. At last he got into the car and started
the engine. Then he stopped, and sat there deep in
thought. At last he suddenly sprang out again, and,
approaching Sam, he said very deliberately :\n\n\t" Old grandfather, I shall require you to accompany me."\n\n\tSam gasped.\n\n\t"Eh?" he said. "What he talkhi' about? 'com-
pany ? I got these here lines o' tarnips â€” I be already
behoind â€” "\n\n\tThe disgusting little revolver once more flashed be-
fore his eyes.\n\n\t" There must be no discussion," came the voice.
"It is necessary that you mount the seat of the car
without delay. Otherwise I shoot you like the dog
you are. So ! "\n\n\tOld Sam w^as hale and hearty. He had no desire to
die so ignominiously. The pleasant smell of the
downland was in his nostrils. Ilis foot was on his na
tive heath. He mounted the seat of the car, content-
ing himself with a mutter:\n\n\t" Well, that be a noice thing, I must say ! Flyin'
about the country with all they tarnips on'y half
thinned â€” "\n\n\tHe found himself strapped in. The aviator was in
a fever of anxiety to get away. The engines made a
ghastly splutter and noise. The thing started running
along the ground. Suddenly it shot upwards, giving
the swedes a last contemptuous kick. At twenty min-
utes to eight that morning old Sam found himself be-
ing borne right up above his fields and out to sea ! His
breath came quickly. He was a little frightened.\n\n\t" God forgive me ! " he murmured.\n\n\tThe thing was so fantastic and sudden, his mind could not grasp it. He only felt in some vague way
that he was going to die, and he struggled to attune his
mind to the change. He offered up a mild prayer to
God, Who, he felt, must be very near, somewhere up
in these clouds. Automatically he thought of the vicar
at Halvesham, and a certain sense of comfort came to
him at the reflection that on the previous day he had
taken a " cooking of runner beans " to God's represent-
ative in that village. He felt calmer after that, but
the horrid machine seemed to go higher and higher.
He could not turn in his seat and he could see nothing
but sea and sky. Of course the man was mad, mad
as a March hare. Of what earthly use could he be
to any one? Besides, he had talked pure gibberish,
and called him Paul Something, when he had already
told him that his name was Sam. The thing would fall
down into the sea soon, and they would both be drowned.
Well, well ! He had reached the three-score years and
ten.\n\n\tHe was protected by a screen, but it seemed very
cold. What on earth would Mr. Dodge say? There
was no one left to work the land but a fool of a boy
named Billy Whitehead at Deric's Cross. On, on, on
they went at a furious pace. His thoughts danced dis-
connectedly from incidents of his youth, conversations
with the vicar, hearty meals in the open, a frock his
sister wore on the day of the postman's wedding, the
drone of a psalm, the illness of some ewes belonging
to Mr. Dodge. Everything seemed to be moving very
rapidly, upsetting his sense of time. He felt out-raged and yet at moments there was something entranc-
ing in the wild experience. He seemed to be living at
an incredible pace. Perhaps he was really dead, and
on his way to the Kingdom of God ? Perhaps this was
the way they took people ?\n\n\tAfter some indefinite period he suddenly caught sight
of a long strip of land. Was this a foreign country?
or were they returning? He had by this time lost all
feeling of fear. He became interested, and almost dis-
appointed. The " airyplane " was not such a fool as
it looked. It was very wonderful to be right up in the
sky like this. His dreams were suddenly disturbed
by a fearful noise. He thought the machine was blown
to pieces. It dived and ducked through the air, and
things were bursting all round it and making an a^vful
din; and then it went up higher and higher. After a
while these noises ceased, and he felt the machine glid-
ing downwards. They were really right above solid
land, trees, and fields, and streams, and white villages.
Down, down, down they glided. This was a foreign
country. There were straight avenues of poplars and
canals. This was not Halvesham. He felt the thing
glide gently and bump into a field. Some men ran
forward and approached them, and the mad aviator
called out to them. They were mostly fat men in gray
uniforms, and they all spoke this foreign gibberish.
Some one came and unstrapped him. He was very
stiff, and could hardly move. An exceptionally gross-
looking man punched him in the ribs, and roared with
laughter. They all stood round and laughed at him, while the mad aviator talked to them and kept pointing
at him. Then he said :\n\n\t" Old grandfather, jou must come with me."
He was led to a zinc-roofed building, and shut in a
little room. There were guards outside with fixed bay-
onets. After a while the mad aviator appeared again,
accompanied by two soldiers. He beckoned him to fol-
low. They marched through a quadrangle and entered
another building. They went straight into an office
where a very important-looking man, covered with
medals, sat in an easy-chair. There was a lot of
saluting and clicking of heels.\n\n\tThe aviator pointed at Sam and said something, and
the man with the medals started at sight of him, and
then came up and spoke to him in English.\n\n\t" What is your name ? Where do you come from ?
Your age ? The name and birthplace of your parents ? "
He seemed intensely interested, and also pulled his
hair and beard to see if they came off. So well and
naturally did he and the aviator speak English that after
a voluble cross-examination they drew apart, and con-
tinued the conversation in that language. And the
extraordinary conversation was of this nature:\n\n\t" It is a most remarkable resemblance," said the man
with medals. " Unghublich ! V>\\t what do you want
me to do with him, Hau^semann ? "\n\n\t" The idea came to me suddenly, excellency," replied
the aviator, " and you may consider it worthless. It is
just this. The resemblance is so amazing. Paul
Jouperts has given us more valuable information than any one at present in our service. And the English
know that. There is an award of twenty-five thousand
francs on liis head. Twice they have captured him,
and each time he escaped. All the company com-
manders and their staff have his photograph. He is a
serious thorn in their flesh."\n\n\t" Well ? " replied the man with the medals.\n\n\tThe aviator whispered confidently:\n\n\t" Suppose, your excellency, that they found the dead
body of Paul Jouperts ? "\n\n\t" Well ? " replied the big man.\n\n\t" My suggestion is this. To-morrow, as you know,
the English are attacking Hill 701, which we have for
tactical reasons decided to evacuate. If after the at-
tack they find the dead body of Paul Jouperts in, say,
the second lines, they will take no further trouble in
the matter. You kriow their lack of thoroughness.
Pardon me, I was two years at Oxford University.
And consequently Paul Jouperts will be able to â€”
prosecute his labors undisturbed."\n\n\tThe man with the medals twirled his mustache and
looked thoughtfully at his colleague.\n\n\t" Where is Paul at the moment ? " he asked.\n\n\t" He is acting as a gardener at the Convent of St.
Eloise at Mailleton-en-haut, which, as you know, is
one hundred meters from the headquarters of the British
central army staff."\n\n\tThe man with the medals took two or three rapid
turns up and down the room. Then he said :\n\n\t" Your plan is excellent, Hausemann. The only point of difficulty is that the attack started this morning."\n\n\t" This morning ? " exclaimed the other.\n\n\t" Yes. The English attacked unexpectedly at dawn.
We have already evacuated the first line. We shall
evacuate the second line at eleven-fifty. It is now
ten-fifteen. There may be just time."\n\n\tHe looked suddenly at old Sam in the way that
a butcher might look at a prize heifer at an agricultural
show, and remarked casually :\n\n\t" Yes, it is a remarkable resemblance. It seems a
pity not to ... do something with it."\n\n\tThen, speaking in German, he added:\n\n\t" It is worth trying, and if it succeeds, the higher
authorities shall hear of your lucky accident and in-
spiration, Herr Hausemann. Instruct Over-lieutenant
Schutz to send the old fool by two orderlies to the east
extremity of trench 38. Keep him there till the order
of evacuation is given. Then shoot him, but don't dis-
figure him, and lay him out face upwards."\n\n\tThe aviator saluted and withdrew, accompanied by
his victim. Old Sam had not understood the latter part
of the conversation, and he did not catch quite all that
was said in English, but he felt that somehow things
were not becoming too promising, and it was time to
assert himself. So he remarked when they got outside :\n\n\t" ISTow, look'ee here, mister, when be I goin' back to
my tamips ? "\n\n\tAnd the aviator replied with a pleasant smile:\n\n\t"Do not be disturbed, old grandfather; you shall
. . . get back to the soil quite soon."\n\n\tIn a few moments he found himself in a large gi-aj
car, accompanied by four soldiers. The aviator left
him. The country was barren and horrible, full of
great pits and rents, and he could hear the roar of
artillery and the shriek of shells. Overhead, aeroplanes
were buzzing angrily. He seemed to be suddenly trans-
ported from the Kingdom of God to the Pit of Dark-
ness. He wondered whether the vicar had enjoyed the
runner-beans. He could not imagine runner-beans
growing here, runner-beans, ay! or anything else. If
this w^as a foreign country, give him dear old England.\n\n\tGr-r-r-r â€” Bang ! Something exploded just at the
rear of the car. The soldiers ducked, and one of them
pushed him in the stomach and swore.\n\n\t" An ugly-looking lout," he thought. " If I w^as
twenty years younger I'd give him a punch in the eye
that 'ud make him sit up."\n\n\tThe car came to a halt by a broken wall. The party
hurried out and dived behind a mound. He was pulled
down a kind of shaft and found himself in a room buried
right underground, where three officers were drinking
and smoking. The soldiers saluted and handed a type-
written dispatch. The officers looked at him drunkenly,
and one came up and pulled his beard and spat in his
face, and called him " an old English swine." He then
shouted out some instructions to the soldiers, and they
led him out into the narrow trench. One walked be-
hind him and occasionally prodded him with the butt-
end of a gim. The trenches were half-full of water,
and reeked of gases, powder, and decaying matter.\n\n\tShells were constantly bursting overhead, and in places
the trenches had crumbled and were nearly blocked
up. They stumbled on, sometimes falling, sometimes
dodging moving masses, and occasionally crawling over
the dead bodies of men. At last they reached a de-
serted-looking trench, and one of the soldiers pushed him
into the corner of it and growled something, and
then disappeared round the angle. Old Sam was ex-
hausted. He lay panting against the mud wall,
expecting every minute to be blown to pieces by one
of those infernal things that seemed to be getting more
and more insistent. The din went on for nearly twenty
minutes, and he was alone in the trench. He fancied
he heard a whistle amidst the din. Suddenly one of
the soldiers who had accompanied him came stealthily
round the corner. And there was a look in his eye
old Sam did not like. When he was within five yards
the soldier raised his rifle and pointed it at Sam's
body. Some instinct impelled the old man at that in-
stant to throw himself forward on his face. As he
did so, he was conscious of a terrible explosion, and he
had just time to observe the soldier falling in a heap
near him, when he lost consciousness.\n\n\tHis consciousness appeared to return to him with a
snap. He was lying on a plank in a building, and he
heard some one say:\n\n\t" I believe the old boy's English."\n\n\tHe looked round. There were a lot of men lying
there, and others in khaki and white overalls were busy\n\n\tamongst them. He sat up and rubbed his head, and
said:\n\n\t" Hi, mister, where be I now ? "\n\n\tSome one laughed, and a young man came up and
said:\n\n\t" Well, old thing, you were very nearly in hell.
Who the devil are you ? "\n\n\tSome one else came up, and the two of them were
discussing him. One of them said :\n\n\t" He's quite all right. He was only knocked out.
Better take him to the colonel. He may be a spy."\n\n\tThe other came up, and touched his shoulder, and
remarked :\n\n\t" Can you walk, uncle ? "\n\n\tHe replied : " Ay, I can walk all right."\n\n\t" That's an old sport ! "\n\n\tThe young man took his arm and helped him out
of the room, into a courtyard. They entered another
room, where an elderlv, kind-faced officer was seated at
a desk. The officer looked up, and exclaimed:\n\n\t" Good God ! Bradshaw, do you know who you've
got there ? "\n\n\tThe younger one said, " No. Wlio, sir ? "\n\n\t"By God! It's Paul Jouperts!" exclaimed the
colonel.\n\n\t" Paul Jouperts ! Great Scott ! "\n\n\tThe old officer addressed himself to Sam. He said:\n\n\t" Well, we've got you once more, Paul. We shall
have to be a little more careful this time."\n\n\tThe young officer said :\n\n\t" Shall I detail a squad, sir ? "\n\n\t"We can't shoot him without a court-martial," re-
plied the kind-faced senior.\n\n\tThen Sam interpolated :\n\n\t" Look'ee here, sir. I'm fair sick of all this. My
name bean't Paul. My name's Sam. I was a-thinnin'
a line of tarnips â€” "\n\n\tBoth officers burst out laughing, and the younger one
said:\n\n\t" Good ! damn good ! Isn't it amazing, sir, the way
they not only leam the language, but even take the
trouble to leam a dialect ? "\n\n\tThe older man busied himself with some papers.\n\n\t" Well, Sam," he remarked, " you shall be given a
chance to prove your identity. Our methods are less
drastic than those of your Boche masters. What part
of England are you supposed to come from ? Let's see
how much you can bluff us with your topographical
knowledge."\n\n\t" Oi was a-thinnin' a loine o' tarnips this morning at
'alf-past seven on Mr. Dodge's farm at Halvesham, when
one o' these 'ere airyplanes come roight down among
the swedes. I tells 'ee to get clear o' that, when the
feller what gets owt o' the car, 'e drabs a revowler and
'e says, ' You must 'company I â€” ' "\n\n\t" Yes, yes," interrupted the senior officer ; " that's all
very good. "Now tell me â€” Where is Halvesham?
What is the name of the local vicar? I'm sure you'd
know that."\n\n\tOld Sam rubbed his chin.\n\n\t" I sits under the Reverend David Pryce, mister, and
a good God-fearin' man he be. I took him a cookin' o'
runner-beans on'y yesterday. I works for Mr. Dodge
what owns Greenway Manor and 'as a stud-farm at
Newmarket they say."\n\n\t" Charles Dodge ? " asked the younger officers.\n\n\t" Ay, Charlie Dodge. You write and ask 'un if he
knows old Sam Gates."\n\n\tThe two officers looked at each other, and the older
one looked at Sam more closely.\n\n\t" It's very extraordinary," he remarked.\n\n\t" Everybody knows Charlie Dodge," added the
younger officer.\n\n\tIt was at that moment that a wave of genius swept
over old Sam. He put his hand to his head, and sud-
denly jerked out :\n\n\t" What's more, I can tell 'ee where this yere Paul is.
He's actin' a gardener in a convent at â€” "\n\n\tHe puckered up his brow and fumbled with his hat,
and then got out:\n\n\t" Mighteno."\n\n\tThe older officer gasped.\n\n\t" Mailleton-en-haut ! Good God ! What makes you
say that, old man ? "\n\n\tSam tried to give an account of his experience, and
the things he had heard said by the German officers.
But he was getting tired, and he broke off in the middle
to say:\n\n\t" Ye haven't a bite o' somethin' to eat, I suppose, mister, and a glass o' beer ? I usually 'as my dinner at
twelve o'clock."\n\n\tBoth the officers laughed, and the older said :
" Get him some food, Bradshaw, and a bottle of beer
from the mess. We'll keep this old man here. He
interests me."\n\n\tWhile the younger man was doing this, the chief
pressed a button and summoned another junior officer.\n\n\t" Gateshead," he remarked, " ring up G. H. Q. and
instruct them to arrest the gardener in that convent at
the top of the hill, and then to report."\n\n\tThe officer saluted and went out, and in a few minutes
a tray of hot food and a large bottle of beer was brought
to the old man, and he was left alone in the corner of
the room to negotiate this welcome compensation. And
in the execution he did himself and his country credit.
In the meanwhile the officers were very busy. People
were coming and going and examining maps and tele-
phone-bells were ringing furiously. They did not dis-
turb old Sam's gastronomic operations. He cleaned
up the mess tins and finished the last drop of beer.
The senior officer found time to offer him a cigarette,
but he replied :\n\n\t" Thank 'ee kindly, but I'd rather smoke my pipe."\n\n\tThe colonel smiled, and said:\n\n\t" Oh, all right. Smoke away."\n\n\tHe lighted up, and the fumes of the shag permeated
the room. Some one opened another window, and the
young officer who had addressed him at first suddenly
looked at him and exclaimed:\n\n\t" Innocent, by God ! You couldn't get shag like that
anywhere but in Norfolk."\n\n\tIt must have been over an hour later when another
officer entered, and saluted.\n\n\t" Message from G. H. Q., sir," he said.\n\n\t" Well ? "\n\n\t" They have arrested the gardener at the convent
of St. Eloise, and they have every reason to believe that
he is the notorious Paul Jouperts."\n\n\tThe colonel stood up, and his eyes beamed. He came
over to old Sam and shook his hand.\n\n\t" Mr. Gates," he said, " you are an old brick.. You
will probably hear more of this. You have probably
been the means of delivering something very useful
into our hands. Your own honor is vindicated. A
loving government will probably award you five shil-
lings or a Victoria Cross, or something of that sort.
In the meantime, what can I do for you ? "\n\n\tOld Sam scratched his chin.\n\n\t" Oi want to get back 'ome," he said.\n\n\t" Well, even that might be arranged."\n\n\t" Oi want to get back 'ome in toime for tea."\n\n\t" Wliat time do you have tea ? "\n\n\t" Foive o'clock or thereabouts."\n\n\t" I see."\n\n\tA kindly smile came into the eyes of the colonel.
He turned to another officer standing by the table, and\n\n\tsaid : '\n\n\t" Raikes, is any one going across this afteraoon with
dispatches ? "\n\n\t" Yes, sir," replied the young officer. " Commander
Jennings is leaving at three o'clock."\n\n\t" You might ask him to come and see me."\n\n\tWithin ten minutes a young man in a flight-com-
mander's uniform entered.\n\n\t" Ah, Jennings," said the colonel, " here is a little
affair which concerns the honor of the British army.
My friend here, Sam Gates, has come over from Halve-
sham in N'orfolk in order to give us valuable informa-
tion. I have promised him that he shall get home to
tea at five o'clock. Can you take a passenger ? "\n\n\tThe young man threw back his head and laughed.\n\n\t" Lord ! " he exclaimed. " What an old sport ! Yes,
I expect I could just manage it. Where is the God-
forsaken place ? "\n\n\tA large ordnance-map of ITorfolk (which had been
captured from a German officer) was produced, and the
young man studied it closely.\n\n\tAt three o'clock precisely old Sam, finding himself
something of a hero and quite glad to escape from the
embarrassment which this position entailed, once more
sped skywards in an " airyplane."\n\n\tAt twenty minutes to five he landed once more
amongst Mr. Dodge's swedes. The breezy young air-
man shook hands with him and departed inland. Old
Sam sat down and surveyed the field.\n\n\t" A noice thing, I must say," he muttered to himself,
as he looked along the lines of unthinned turnips. He
still had twenty minutes, and so he went slowly along
and completed a line which he had commenced in the\n\n\tmorning. He then deliberately packed up his dinner-
things and his tools, and started out for home.\n\n\tAs he came round the corner of Still way's Meadow,
and the cottage came in view, his niece stepped out of
the copse with a basket on her arm.\n\n\t" Well, uncle," she said, " is there any noos ? "\n\n\tIt was then that old Sam became really irritated.\n\n\t" Noos ! " he said. " Noos ! drat the girl ! What
noos should there be? Sixty-nine year I live in these
here parts, hoein' and weedin' and thinnin', and mindin'
Charlie Dodge's sheep. Am I one o' these here story-
book folk havin' noos 'appen to me all the time ? Ain't
it enough, ye silly dab-faced zany, to earn enough to
buy a bite o' some' at to eat, and a glass o' beer, and a
place to rest a's head o'night, without always wantin'
noos, noos, noos ! I tell 'ee, it's this that leads 'ee
to 'alf the troubles in the world. Devil take the noos ! "\n\n\tAnd turning his back on her, he went fuming up the
hill.\n\n\t10
