"There's our ford," said Juan,--our half-blood trailer,--pointing to
the slightest sag in a low range of hills distant twenty miles.
We were Texas Rangers. It was nearly noon of a spring day, and we
had halted on sighting our destination,--Comanche Ford on the Concho
River. Less than three days before, we had been lounging around camp,
near Tepee City, one hundred and seventy-five miles northeast of our
present destination. A courier had reached us with an emergency order,
which put every man in the saddle within an hour after its receipt.
An outfit with eight hundred cattle had started west up the Concho.
Their destination was believed to be New Mexico. Suspicion rested on
them, as they had failed to take out inspection papers for moving the
cattle, and what few people had seen them declared that one half the
cattle were brand burnt or blotched beyond recognition. Besides, they
had an outfit of twenty heavily armed men, or twice as many as were
required to manage a herd of that size.
Our instructions were to make this crossing with all possible haste,
and if our numbers were too few, there to await assistance before
dropping down the river to meet the herd. When these courier orders
reached us at Tepee, they found only twelve men in camp, with not an
officer above a corporal. Fortunately we had Dad Root with us, a man
whom every man in our company would follow as though he had been
our captain. He had not the advantage in years that his name would
indicate, but he was an exceedingly useful man in the service. He
could resight a gun, shoe a horse, or empty a six-shooter into a tree
from the back of a running horse with admirable accuracy. In dressing
a gun-shot wound, he had the delicate touch of a woman. Every man
in the company went to him with his petty troubles, and came away
delighted. Therefore there was no question as to who should be our
leader on this raid; no one but Dad was even considered.
Sending a brief note to the adjutant-general by this same courier,
stating that we had started with twelve men, we broke camp, and in
less than an hour were riding southwest. One thing which played into
our hands in making this forced ride was the fact that we had a number
of extra horses on hand. For a few months previous we had captured
quite a number of stolen horses, and having no chance to send into the
settlements where they belonged, we used them as extra riding horses.
With our pack mules light and these extra saddlers for a change, we
covered the country rapidly. Sixteen hours a day in the saddle makes
camp-fires far apart. Dad, too, could always imagine that a few miles
farther on we would find a fine camping spot, and his views were law
to us.
We had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as
Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our
destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. "Boys," said Dad,
"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big
pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as
fresh as pond-lilies."
"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tWe were Texas Rangers. It was nearly noon of a spring day, and we
had halted on sighting our destination,--Comanche Ford on the Concho
River. Less than three days before, we had been lounging around camp,
near Tepee City, one hundred and seventy-five miles northeast of our
present destination. A courier had reached us with an emergency order,
which put every man in the saddle within an hour after its receipt.
An outfit with eight hundred cattle had started west up the Concho.
Their destination was believed to be New Mexico. Suspicion rested on
them, as they had failed to take out inspection papers for moving the
cattle, and what few people had seen them declared that one half the
cattle were brand burnt or blotched beyond recognition. Besides, they
had an outfit of twenty heavily armed men, or twice as many as were
required to manage a herd of that size.
Our instructions were to make this crossing with all possible haste,
and if our numbers were too few, there to await assistance before
dropping down the river to meet the herd. When these courier orders
reached us at Tepee, they found only twelve men in camp, with not an
officer above a corporal. Fortunately we had Dad Root with us, a man
whom every man in our company would follow as though he had been
our captain. He had not the advantage in years that his name would
indicate, but he was an exceedingly useful man in the service. He
could resight a gun, shoe a horse, or empty a six-shooter into a tree
from the back of a running horse with admirable accuracy. In dressing
a gun-shot wound, he had the delicate touch of a woman. Every man
in the company went to him with his petty troubles, and came away
delighted. Therefore there was no question as to who should be our
leader on this raid; no one but Dad was even considered.
Sending a brief note to the adjutant-general by this same courier,
stating that we had started with twelve men, we broke camp, and in
less than an hour were riding southwest. One thing which played into
our hands in making this forced ride was the fact that we had a number
of extra horses on hand. For a few months previous we had captured
quite a number of stolen horses, and having no chance to send into the
settlements where they belonged, we used them as extra riding horses.
With our pack mules light and these extra saddlers for a change, we
covered the country rapidly. Sixteen hours a day in the saddle makes
camp-fires far apart. Dad, too, could always imagine that a few miles
farther on we would find a fine camping spot, and his views were law
to us.
We had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as
Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our
destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. "Boys," said Dad,
"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big
pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as
fresh as pond-lilies."
"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tAn outfit with eight hundred cattle had started west up the Concho.
Their destination was believed to be New Mexico. Suspicion rested on
them, as they had failed to take out inspection papers for moving the
cattle, and what few people had seen them declared that one half the
cattle were brand burnt or blotched beyond recognition. Besides, they
had an outfit of twenty heavily armed men, or twice as many as were
required to manage a herd of that size.
Our instructions were to make this crossing with all possible haste,
and if our numbers were too few, there to await assistance before
dropping down the river to meet the herd. When these courier orders
reached us at Tepee, they found only twelve men in camp, with not an
officer above a corporal. Fortunately we had Dad Root with us, a man
whom every man in our company would follow as though he had been
our captain. He had not the advantage in years that his name would
indicate, but he was an exceedingly useful man in the service. He
could resight a gun, shoe a horse, or empty a six-shooter into a tree
from the back of a running horse with admirable accuracy. In dressing
a gun-shot wound, he had the delicate touch of a woman. Every man
in the company went to him with his petty troubles, and came away
delighted. Therefore there was no question as to who should be our
leader on this raid; no one but Dad was even considered.
Sending a brief note to the adjutant-general by this same courier,
stating that we had started with twelve men, we broke camp, and in
less than an hour were riding southwest. One thing which played into
our hands in making this forced ride was the fact that we had a number
of extra horses on hand. For a few months previous we had captured
quite a number of stolen horses, and having no chance to send into the
settlements where they belonged, we used them as extra riding horses.
With our pack mules light and these extra saddlers for a change, we
covered the country rapidly. Sixteen hours a day in the saddle makes
camp-fires far apart. Dad, too, could always imagine that a few miles
farther on we would find a fine camping spot, and his views were law
to us.
We had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as
Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our
destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. "Boys," said Dad,
"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big
pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as
fresh as pond-lilies."
"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tOur instructions were to make this crossing with all possible haste,
and if our numbers were too few, there to await assistance before
dropping down the river to meet the herd. When these courier orders
reached us at Tepee, they found only twelve men in camp, with not an
officer above a corporal. Fortunately we had Dad Root with us, a man
whom every man in our company would follow as though he had been
our captain. He had not the advantage in years that his name would
indicate, but he was an exceedingly useful man in the service. He
could resight a gun, shoe a horse, or empty a six-shooter into a tree
from the back of a running horse with admirable accuracy. In dressing
a gun-shot wound, he had the delicate touch of a woman. Every man
in the company went to him with his petty troubles, and came away
delighted. Therefore there was no question as to who should be our
leader on this raid; no one but Dad was even considered.
Sending a brief note to the adjutant-general by this same courier,
stating that we had started with twelve men, we broke camp, and in
less than an hour were riding southwest. One thing which played into
our hands in making this forced ride was the fact that we had a number
of extra horses on hand. For a few months previous we had captured
quite a number of stolen horses, and having no chance to send into the
settlements where they belonged, we used them as extra riding horses.
With our pack mules light and these extra saddlers for a change, we
covered the country rapidly. Sixteen hours a day in the saddle makes
camp-fires far apart. Dad, too, could always imagine that a few miles
farther on we would find a fine camping spot, and his views were law
to us.
We had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as
Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our
destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. "Boys," said Dad,
"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big
pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as
fresh as pond-lilies."
"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tSending a brief note to the adjutant-general by this same courier,
stating that we had started with twelve men, we broke camp, and in
less than an hour were riding southwest. One thing which played into
our hands in making this forced ride was the fact that we had a number
of extra horses on hand. For a few months previous we had captured
quite a number of stolen horses, and having no chance to send into the
settlements where they belonged, we used them as extra riding horses.
With our pack mules light and these extra saddlers for a change, we
covered the country rapidly. Sixteen hours a day in the saddle makes
camp-fires far apart. Dad, too, could always imagine that a few miles
farther on we would find a fine camping spot, and his views were law
to us.
We had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as
Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our
destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. "Boys," said Dad,
"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big
pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as
fresh as pond-lilies."
"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tWe had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as
Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our
destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. "Boys," said Dad,
"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big
pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as
fresh as pond-lilies."
"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?" inquired Orchard. "That's a
Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a
swim would improve our good looks?" The fact that, after a ride like
the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with
fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.
For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tFor this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,
and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of
Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.
We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all
morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and
tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.
The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,
and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on
picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no
thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring
freshets had made.
Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

Return to the Andy Adams library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tDad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and
shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school
of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from
which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid
goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit
of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so
bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded
a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was
sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,
patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--
"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my
picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.
Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up
your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that
attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall
entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way
and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old
man."
Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tOrchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the
water, and ventured, "Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have
a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it
to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this
old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the
picture. Remind me of it, John, and I'll have some taken, and you
shall have one."
A few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tA few minutes later Happy Jack took his place on the rim of the rock
to make a dive, his magnificent physique of six feet and two hundred
pounds looming up like a Numidian cavalryman, when Dad observed,
"How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with
pox-marks, and there's none on your body?"
"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"Just because they come that way, I reckon," was the answer
vouchsafed. "You may think I'm funning, lads, but I never felt so
supremely happy in all my life as when I got well of the smallpox. I
had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with
them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to
work." Here, as he poised on tiptoe, with his hands gracefully arched
over his head for a dive, he was arrested in the movement by a comment
of one of the boys, to the effect that he "couldn't see anything in
that to make a man so supremely happy."
He turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tHe turned his head halfway round at the speaker, and never losing his
poise, remarked, "Well, but you must recollect that there was five of
us taken down at the same time, and the other four died," and he made
a graceful spring, boring a hole in the water, which seethed around
him, arising a moment later throwing water like a porpoise, as though
he wouldn't exchange his position in life, humble as it was, with any
one of a thousand dead heroes.
After an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.

revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tAfter an hour in the water and a critical examination of all the old
gun-shot wounds of our whole squad, and the consequent verdict that
it was simply impossible to kill a man, we returned to camp and began
getting supper. There was no stomach so sensitive amongst us that it
couldn't assimilate bacon, beans, and black coffee.
When we had done justice to the supper, the twilight hours of the
evening were spent in making camp snug for the night. Every horse
or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle
blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat.
The night air was so dry and warm that they would even dry at night.
There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of
firearms. As night settled over the camp, everything was in order. The
blankets were spread, and smoking and yarning occupied the time until
sleep claimed us.
"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"Talking about the tight places," said Orchard, "in which a man often
finds himself in this service, reminds me of a funny experience which
I once had, out on the head-waters of the Brazos. I've smelt powder at
short range, and I'm willing to admit there's nothing fascinating in
it. But this time I got buffaloed by a bear.
"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.

their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"There are a great many brakes on the head of the Brazos, and in them
grow cedar thickets. I forget now what the duty was that we were there
on, but there were about twenty of us in the detachment at the time.
One morning, shortly after daybreak, another lad and myself walked
out to unhobble some extra horses which we had with us. The horses
had strayed nearly a mile from camp, and when we found them they were
cutting up as if they had been eating loco weed for a month. When we
came up to them, we saw that they were scared. These horses couldn't
talk, but they told us that just over the hill was something they were
afraid of.
"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to

"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually

they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of

minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."

"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause
of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon. He was feeding along, heading
for a thicket of about ten acres. The lad who was with me stayed and
watched him, while I hurried back, unhobbled the horses, and rushed
them into camp. I hustled out every man, and they cinched their hulls
on those horses rapidly. By the time we had reached the lad who had
stayed to watch him, the bear had entered the thicket, but unalarmed.
Some fool suggested the idea that we could drive him out in the open
and rope him. The lay of the land would suggest such an idea, for
beyond this motte of cedar lay an impenetrable thicket of over a
hundred acres, which we thought he would head for if alarmed. There
was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear
should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine mark for a rope.
"Well, I always was handy with a rope, and the boys knew it, so I and
three others who could twirl a rope were sent around on this divide,
to rope him in case he came out. The others left their horses and made
a half-circle drive through the grove, beating the brush and burning
powder as though it didn't cost anything. We ropers up on the divide
scattered out, hiding ourselves as much as we could in the broken
places. We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice.
He must have been a sullen old fellow, for we were beginning to think
they had missed him or he had holed, when he suddenly lumbered out
directly opposite me and ambled away towards the big thicket.
"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that

There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits

over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched
into a pile on the ground, and securely tied with a three-eighths-inch
rope. The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and
at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us. The horse
cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I
enlisted. I didn't know it at the time, but my six-shooter had fallen
out of the holster, while the horse was lying on my carbine.
"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever
was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen
a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a
cat after a mouse. The first sniff he caught of the bear, he whirled
quicker than lightning, but I had made my cast, and the loop settled
over Mr. Bear's shoulders, with one of his fore feet through it. I
had tied the rope in a hard knot to the pommel, and the way my horse
checked that bear was a caution. It must have made bruin mad. My horse
snorted and spun round like a top, and in less time than it takes to
tell it, there was a bear, a cream-colored horse, and a man sandwiched

cried with fear as though he was being burnt to death, while the bear
grinned and blew his breath in my face. The running noose in the rope
had cut his wind so badly, he could hardly offer much resistance. It
was a good thing he had his wind cut, or he would have made me sorry I

for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed
killing. Horse, bear, and man were so badly mixed up, they dared not
shoot. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp
he looked like a ghost, while one finally found his senses and,
dismounting, cut the rope in half a dozen places and untied the
bundle. My horse floundered to his feet and ran off, but before the
bear could free the noose, the boys got enough lead into him at close
quarters to hold him down. The entire detachment came out of the
thicket, and their hilarity knew no bounds. I was the only man in the
crowd who didn't enjoy the bear chase. Right then I made a resolve
that hereafter, when volunteers are called for to rope a bear, my
accomplishments in that line will remain unmentioned by me. I'll eat
my breakfast first, anyhow, and think it over carefully."
"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of

disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear," said one of the
boys. "Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get
a sniff of one, and he'll get up his bristles like a javeline and tuck
his tail and look about for good backing or a clear field to run."
Long John showed symptoms that he had some yarn to relate, so we
naturally remained silent to give him a chance, in case the spirit
moved in him. Throwing a brand into the fare after lighting his
cigarette, he stretched himself on the ground, and the expected
happened.
"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The

When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be

"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.

Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"A few years ago, while rangering down the country," said he, "four
of us had trailed some horse-thieves down on the Rio Grande, when they
gave us the slip by crossing over into Mexico. We knew the thieves
were just across the river, so we hung around a few days, in the hope
of catching them, for if they should recross into Texas they were our
meat. Our plans were completely upset the next morning, by the
arrival of twenty United States cavalrymen on the cold trail of four
deserters. The fact that these deserters were five days ahead and had
crossed into Mexico promptly on reaching the river, did not prevent
this squad of soldiers from notifying both villages on each side of
the river as to their fruitless errand. They couldn't follow their own
any farther, and they managed to scare our quarry into hiding in the
interior. We waited until the soldiers returned to the post, when we
concluded we would take a little pasear over into Mexico on our own
account.
"We called ourselves horse-buyers. The government was paying like
thirty dollars for deserters, and in case we run across them, we
figured it would pay expenses to bring them out. These deserters
were distinguishable wherever they went by the size of their horses;
besides, they had two fine big American mules for packs. They were
marked right for that country. Everything about them was muy grande.
We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and
forty miles in the interior. They had celebrated their desertion
the day previous to our arrival by getting drunk, and when the
horse-buyers arrived they were in jail. This last condition rather
frustrated our plans for their capture, as we expected to kidnap them
out. But now we had red tape authorities to deal with.
"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,

might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,

was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would
be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern
of the corral-keeper. Two of the boys who were in the party could
palaver Spanish, so they concluded to visit the alcalde of the town,
inquiring after horses in general and incidentally finding out when
our deserters would be released. The alcalde received the boys with
great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town, and
after giving them all the information available regarding horses,
the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The
alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and
not knowing just what to do with them he had sent a courier that very
morning to the governor for instructions in the matter. He estimated
it would require at least ten days to receive the governor's reply. In
the mean time, much as he regretted it, they would remain prisoners.
Before parting, those two innocents permitted their host to open a
bottle of wine as an evidence of the friendly feeling, and at the
final leave-taking, they wasted enough politeness on each other to win
a woman.
"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at

we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"When the boys returned to us other two, we were at our wits' end. We
were getting disappointed too often. The result was that we made up
our minds that rather than throw up, we would take those deserters out
of jail and run the risk of getting away with them. We had everything
in readiness an hour before nightfall. We explained, to the
satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge,
that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail
possibly a month, and to avoid the expense of their keeping, we would
settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When
the time came every horse was saddled and the mules packed and in
readiness. We had even moved our own stock into the same corral, which
was only a short distance from the jail.
"As night set in we approached the carsel. The turnkey answered our
questions very politely through a grated iron door, and to our request
to speak with the prisoners, he regretted that they were being fed at
that moment, and we would have to wait a few minutes. He unbolted the
door, however, and offered to show us into a side room, an invitation
we declined. Instead, we relieved him of his keys and made known our
errand. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,
he was speechless with terror. It was short work to find the men we
wanted and march them out, locking the gates behind us and taking
jailer and keys with us. Once in the saddle, we bade the poor turnkey
good-by and returned him his keys.
"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion

second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.

necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"We rode fast, but in less than a quarter of an hour there was a
clanging of bells which convinced us that the alarm had been given.
Our prisoners took kindly to the rescue and rode willingly, but we
were careful to conceal our identity or motive. We felt certain
there would be pursuit, if for no other purpose, to justify official
authority. We felt easy, for we were well mounted, and if it came to a
pinch, we would burn powder with them, one round at least.
"Before half an hour had passed, we were aware that we were pursued.
We threw off the road at right angles and rode for an hour. Then, with
the North Star for a guide, we put over fifty miles behind us before
sunrise. It was impossible to secrete ourselves the next day, for we
were compelled to have water for ourselves and stock. To conceal the
fact that our friends were prisoners, we returned them their arms
after throwing away their ammunition. We had to enter several ranches
during the day to secure food and water, but made no particular effort
to travel.
"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just

but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"About four o'clock we set out, and to our surprise, too, a number
of horsemen followed us until nearly dark. Passing through a slight
shelter, in which we were out of sight some little time, two of us
dropped back and awaited our pursuers. As they came up within hailing
distance, we ordered them to halt, which they declined by whirling
their horses and burning the earth getting away. We threw a few rounds
of lead after them, but they cut all desire for our acquaintance right
there.
"We reached the river at a nearer point than the one at which we had
entered, and crossed to the Texas side early the next morning. We
missed a good ford by two miles and swam the river. At this ford was
stationed a squad of regulars, and we turned our prizes over within
an hour after crossing. We took a receipt for the men, stock,
and equipments, and when we turned it over to our captain a week
afterwards, we got the riot act read to us right. I noticed, however,
the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for
the capture of four deserters."
"I don't reckon that captain had any scruples about taking his share
of the prize money, did he?" inquired Gotch.
"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were

us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"No, I never knew anything like that to happen since I've been in the
service."
"There used to be a captain in one of the upper country companies that
held religious services in his company, and the boys claimed that
he was equally good on a prayer, a fight, or holding aces in a poker
game," said Gotch, as he filled his pipe.
Amongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther

fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\tAmongst Dad's other accomplishments was his unfailing readiness to
tell of his experiences in the service. So after he had looked over
the camp in general, he joined the group of lounging smokers and told
us of an Indian fight in which he had participated.
"I can't imagine how this comes to be called Comanche Ford," said Dad.
"Now the Comanches crossed over into the Panhandle country annually
for the purpose of killing buffalo. For diversion and pastime,
they were always willing to add horse-stealing and the murdering of
settlers as a variation. They used to come over in big bands to
hunt, and when ready to go back to their reservation in the Indian
Territory, they would send the squaws on ahead, while the bucks would
split into small bands and steal all the good horses in sight.
"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"Our old company was ordered out on the border once, when the
Comanches were known to be south of Red River killing buffalo. This
meant that on their return it would be advisable to look out for your
horses or they would be missing. In order to cover as much territory
as possible, the company was cut in three detachments. Our squad had
twenty men in it under a lieutenant. We were patrolling a country
known as the Tallow Cache Hills, glades and black-jack cross timbers
alternating. All kinds of rumors of Indian depredations were reaching
us almost daily, yet so far we had failed to locate or see an Indian.
"One day at noon we packed up and were going to move our camp farther
west, when a scout, who had gone on ahead, rushed back with the news
that he had sighted a band of Indians with quite a herd of horses
pushing north. We led our pack mules, and keeping the shelter of the
timber started to cut them off in their course. When we first sighted
them, they were just crossing a glade, and the last buck had just left
the timber. He had in his mouth an arrow shaft, which he was turning
between his teeth to remove the sap. All had guns. The first warning
the Indians received of our presence was a shot made by one of the
men at this rear Indian. He rolled off his horse like a stone, and
the next morning when we came back over their trail, he had that
unfinished arrow in a death grip between his teeth. That first shot
let the cat out, and we went after them.
"We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those
Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and
dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges. Nearly
every buck was riding a stolen horse, and for some cause they couldn't
get any speed out of them. We just rode all around them. There proved
to be twenty-two Indians in the band, and one of them was a squaw. She
was killed by accident.
"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"The chase had covered about two miles, when the horse she was riding
fell from a shot by some of our crowd. The squaw recovered herself and
came to her feet in time to see several carbines in the act of
being leveled at her by our men. She instantly threw open the slight
covering about her shoulders and revealed her sex. Some one called out
not to shoot, that it was a squaw, and the carbines were lowered. As
this squad passed on, she turned and ran for the protection of the
nearest timber, and a second squad coming up and seeing the fleeing
Indian, fired on her, killing her instantly. She had done the very
thing she should not have done.
"It was a running fight from start to finish. We got the last one in
the band about seven miles from the first one. The last one to fall
was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently,
he ought to have escaped. The funny thing about it was he was
overtaken by the dullest, sleepiest horse in our command. The shooting
and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he died a hero.
When this last Indian saw that he was going to be overtaken, his own
horse being recently wounded, he hung on one side of the animal
and returned the fire. At a range of ten yards he planted a bullet
squarely in the leader's forehead, his own horse falling at the same
instant. Those two horses fell dead so near that you could have tied
their tails together. Our man was thrown so suddenly, that he came to
his feet dazed, his eyes filled with dirt. The Indian stood not twenty
steps away and fired several shots at him. Our man, in his blindness,
stood there and beat the air with his gun, expecting the Indian to
rush on him every moment. Had the buck used his gun for a club, it
might have been different, but as long as he kept shooting, his enemy
was safe. Half a dozen of us, who were near enough to witness his
final fight, dashed up, and the Indian fell riddled with bullets.
"We went into camp after the fight was over with two wounded men and
half a dozen dead or disabled horses. Those of us who had mounts in
good fix scoured back and gathered in our packs and all the Indian and
stolen horses that were unwounded. It looked like a butchery, but our
minds were greatly relieved on that point the next day, when we found
among their effects over a dozen fresh, bloody scalps, mostly women
and children. There's times and circumstances in this service that
make the toughest of us gloomy."
"How long ago was that?" inquired Orchard.
"Quite a while ago," replied Dad. "I ought to be able to tell exactly.
I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the
reconstruction days, when Davis was governor. Figure it out yourself."
"Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service," said Happy Jack,
"reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one
connected with it. When I first went into the service, there was a
well-known horse-thief and smuggler down on the river, known as El
Lobo. He operated on both sides of the Rio Grande, but generally stole
his horses from the Texas side. He was a night owl. It was nothing for
him to be seen at some ranch in the evening, and the next morning
be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,

be met seventy-five or eighty miles distant. He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, and never stole any but the best. His market was well in
the interior of Mexico, and he supplied it liberally. He was a typical
dandy, and like a sailor had a wife in every port. That was his weak
point, and there's where we attacked him.
"He had made all kinds of fun of this service, and we concluded to
have him at any cost. Accordingly we located his women and worked on
them. Mexican beauty is always over-rated, but one of his conquests
in that line came as near being the ideal for a rustic beauty as that
nationality produces. This girl was about twenty, and lived with a
questionable mother at a ranchito back from the river about thirty
miles. In form and feature there was nothing lacking, while the
smouldering fire of her black eyes would win saint or thief alike.
Born in poverty and ignorance, she was a child of circumstance, and
fell an easy victim to El Lobo, who lavished every attention upon her.
There was no present too costly for him, and on his periodical visits
he dazzled her with gifts. But infatuations of that class generally
have an end, often a sad one.
"We had a half-blood in our company, who was used as a rival to El
Lobo in gathering any information that might be afloat, and at
the same time, when opportunity offered, in sowing the wormwood of
jealousy. This was easy, for we collected every item in the form of
presents he ever made her rival senoritas. When these forces were
working, our half-blood pushed his claims for recognition. Our wages
and prize money were at his disposal, and in time they won. The
neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him,
apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first
opportunity--on one condition. And that was, that if we succeeded in
capturing him, we were to bring him before her, that she might, in his
helplessness, taunt him for his perfidy towards her. We were willing
to make any concession to get him, so this request was readily
granted.
"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
"It was almost midnight when we reached the ranchito where the girl
lived. We asked him if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished
to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

to see. This he denied. When we informed him that by special request
a lady wished to bid him farewell, he lost some of his bluster and
bravado. We all dismounted, leaving one man outside with the other
two prisoners, and entered a small yard where the girl lived. Our
half-blood aroused her and called her out to meet her friend, El Lobo.
The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the
necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When
the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just
moonlight enough to make her look beautiful.
"As she advanced, she called him by some pet name in their language,
when he answered her gruffly, accusing her of treachery, and turned
his back upon her. She approached within a few feet, when it was
noticeable that she was racked with emotion, and asked him if he had
no kind word for her. Turning on her, he repeated the accusation of
treachery, and applied a vile expression to her. That moment the
girl flashed into a fiend, and throwing a shawl from her shoulders,
revealed a pistol, firing it twice before a man could stop her. El
Lobo sank in his tracks, and she begged us to let her trample his
lifeless body. Later, when composed, she told us that we had not used
her any more than she had used us, in bringing him helpless to her. As
things turned out it looked that way.
"We lashed the dead thief on his horse and rode until daybreak, when
we buried him. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or
alive, and we had the evidence of his death, but the manner in which
we got it made it undesirable. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of
his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two
prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had
attempted to strangle her, and we shot him to save her. Something had
to be said."
The smoking and yarning had ended. Darkness had settled over the camp
but a short while, when every one was sound asleep. It must have
been near midnight when a number of us were aroused by the same
disturbance. The boys sat bolt upright and listened eagerly. We were
used to being awakened by shots, and the cause of our sudden awakening
was believed to be the same,--a shot. While the exchange of opinion
was going the round, all anxiety on that point was dispelled by a
second shot, the flash of which could be distinctly seen across the
river below the ford.
As Dad stood up and answered it with a shrill whistle, every man
reached for his carbine and flattened himself out on the ground. The
whistle was answered, and shortly the splash of quite a cavalcade
could be heard fording the river. Several times they halted, our fire
having died out, and whistles were exchanged between them and Root.
When they came within fifty yards of camp and their outlines could be
distinguished against the sky line in the darkness, they were ordered
to halt, and a dozen carbines clicked an accompaniment to the order.
"Who are you?" demanded Root.
"A detachment from Company M, Texas Rangers," was the reply.
"If you are Rangers, give us a maxim of the service," said Dad.
"Don't wait for the other man to shoot first," came the response.
"Ride in, that passes here," was Dad's greeting and welcome.
They were a detachment of fifteen men, and had ridden from the Pecos
on the south, nearly the same distance which we had come. They had
similar orders to ours, but were advised that they would meet our
detachment at this ford. In less than an hour every man was asleep
again, and quiet reigned in the Ranger camp at Comanche Ford on the
Concho.

A Winter Round-Up\n\n\t"The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to
our advantage as well as his. The few families that dwelt there had
their flocks to look after, and the coming or going of a passer-by was
scarcely noticed. Our man on his visits carefully concealed the fact
that he was connected with this service, for El Lobo's lavish use
of money made him friends wherever he went, and afforded him all the
seclusion he needed.
"It was over a month before the wolf made his appearance, and we were
informed of the fact. He stayed at an outside pastor's camp, visiting
the ranch only after dark. A corral was mentioned, where within a few
days' time, at the farthest, he would pen a bunch of saddle horses.
There had once been wells at this branding pen, but on their failing
to furnish water continuously they had been abandoned. El Lobo had
friends at his command to assist him in securing the best horses in
the country. So accordingly we planned to pay our respects to him at
these deserted wells.
"The second night of our watch, we were rewarded by having three men
drive into these corrals about twenty saddle horses. They had barely
time to tie their mounts outside and enter the pen, when four of us
slipped in behind them and changed the programme a trifle. El Lobo was
one of the men. He was very polite and nice, but that didn't prevent
us from ironing him securely, as we did his companions also.
