A Bear roaming the woods in search of berries happened on a
fallen tree in which a swarm of Bees had stored their honey. The
Bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if
the Bees were at home. Just then one of the swarm came home from
the clover field with a load of sweets. Guessing what the Bear
was after, the Bee flew at him, stung him sharply and then
disappeared into the hollow log.\n\n\tThe Bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the log
tooth and claw, to destroy the nest. But this only brought out
the whole swarm. The poor Bear had to take to his heels, and he
was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water.\n\n\tIt is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke a
thousand by flying into a rage.\n\n\t8.7
