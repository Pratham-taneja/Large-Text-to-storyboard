A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get
some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not
draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a
single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed
and disappointed he began to cry.\n\n\t"My boy," said his mother, "be satisfied with half the nuts you
have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps
you may have some more filberts some other time."\n\n\tDo not attempt too much at once.\n\n\t8.6
