Some Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth. A Fox chanced to see them and laughed scornfully.\n\n\t"If that Lion had been alive," he said, "it would have been a very different story. He would have made you feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth."\n\n\tIt is easy and also contemptible to kick a man that is down.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
