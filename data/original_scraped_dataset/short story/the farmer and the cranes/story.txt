Some Cranes saw a farmer plowing a large field. When the work of
plowing was done, they patiently watched him sow the seed. It was
their feast, they thought.\n\n\tSo, as soon as the Farmer had finished planting and had gone
home, down they flew to the field, and began to eat as fast as
they could.\n\n\tThe Farmer, of course, knew the Cranes and their ways. He had had
experience with such birds before. He soon returned to the field
with a sling. But he did not bring any stones with him. He
expected to scare the Cranes just by swinging the sling in the
air, and shouting loudly at them.\n\n\tAt first the Cranes flew away in great terror. But they soon
began to see that none of them ever got hurt. They did not even
hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for
words, they would kill nobody. At last they paid no attention
whatever to the Farmer.\n\n\tThe Farmer saw that he would have to take other measures. He
wanted to save at least some of his grain. So he loaded his sling
with stones and killed several of the Cranes. This had the effect
the Farmer wanted, for from that day the Cranes visited his field
no more.\n\n\tBluff and threatening words are of little value with rascals.\n\n\tBluff is no proof that hard fists are lacking.\n\n\t7.6
