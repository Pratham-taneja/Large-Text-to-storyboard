A Farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning. On the
ground lay a Snake, stiff and frozen with the cold. The Farmer
knew how deadly the Snake could be, and yet he picked it up and
put it in his bosom to warm it back to life.\n\n\tThe Snake soon revived, and when it had enough strength, bit the
man who had been so kind to it. The bite was deadly and the
Farmer felt that he must die. As he drew his last breath, he said
to those standing around:\n\n\tLearn from my fate not to take pity on a scoundrel.\n\n\t7.4
