A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:\n\n\t"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal."\n\n\tBut the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.\n\n\t"How foolish I should be," he said, "to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all."\n\n\tA small gain is worth more than a large promise.\n\n\tYou may also enjoy reading a parody of this story in a poem titled, The Microscopic Trout and the Machiavellian Fisherman..\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
