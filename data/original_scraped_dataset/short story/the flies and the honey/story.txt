A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on
the table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large
number of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an
invitation. No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, to
gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to
foot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pull
their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving their
lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.\n\n\tBe not greedy for a little passing pleasure. It may destroy
you.\n\n\tA related adage: "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
