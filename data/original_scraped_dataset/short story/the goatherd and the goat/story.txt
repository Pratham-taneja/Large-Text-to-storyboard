A Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover.
The Goatherd tried to call it back, but in vain. It would not
obey him. Then he picked up a stone and threw it, breaking the
Goat's horn.\n\n\tThe Goatherd was frightened.\n\n\t"Do not tell the master," he begged the Goat.\n\n\t"No," said the Goat, "that broken horn can speak for itself!"\n\n\tWicked deeds will not stay hid.\n\n\tIt's no use trying to hide what can't be hidden.
