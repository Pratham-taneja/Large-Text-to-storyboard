On the way they passed a pond where a family of Frogs was sitting among the reeds on the bank. In an instant the startled Frogs were seeking safety in the mud.\n\n\t"Look," cried a Hare, "things are not so bad after all, for here are creatures who are even afraid of us!"\n\n\tHowever unfortunate we may think we are there is always someone worse off than ourselves.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
