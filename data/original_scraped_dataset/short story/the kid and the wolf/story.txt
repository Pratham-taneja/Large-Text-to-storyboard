A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep him out of harm's way. The Kid was browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a Wolf and began to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his heart's content.\n\n\t"I hear you," said the Wolf, "and I haven't the least grudge against you for what you say or do. When you are up there it is the roof that's talking, not you."\n\n\tDo not say anything at any time that you would not say at all times.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
