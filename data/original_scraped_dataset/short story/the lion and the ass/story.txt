One day as the Lion walked proudly down a forest aisle, and the animals respectfully made way for him, an Ass brayed a scornful remark as he passed.\n\n\tThe Lion felt a flash of anger. But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken, he walked quietly on. He would not honor the fool with even so much as a stroke of his claws.\n\n\tDo not resent the remarks of a fool. Ignore them.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
