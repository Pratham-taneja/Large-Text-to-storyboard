A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his
paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her
fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused
from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny
creature to kill her.\n\n\t"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day
I will surely repay you."\n\n\tThe Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help
him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.\n\n\tSome days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion
was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free
himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse
knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net.
Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it
until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.\n\n\t"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now
you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."\n\n\tA kindness is never wasted.\n\n\tThis story is featured in our selection of Children's Stories and Favorite Fairy Tales.\n\n\t9.0
