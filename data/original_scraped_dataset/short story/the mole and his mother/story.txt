A little Mole once said to his Mother:\n\n\t"Why, Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see!"\n\n\tMother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.\n\n\tThe little Mole peered at it.\n\n\t"Why, that's a pebble!"\n\n\t"Well, my son, that proves you've lost your sense of smell as well as being blind."\n\n\tBoast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
