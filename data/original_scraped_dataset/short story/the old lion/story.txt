A Lion had grown very old. His teeth were worn away. His limbs
could no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful
indeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die.\n\n\tWhere now his strength and his former graceful beauty?\n\n\tNow a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his
yellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even a
contemptible Ass let fly his heels and brayed his insults in the
face of the Lion.\n\n\tIt is cowardly to attack the defenseless, though he be an
enemy.\n\n\t8.3
