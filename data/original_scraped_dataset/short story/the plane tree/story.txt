Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.\n\n\t"How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."\n\n\t"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"\n\n\tOur best blessings are often the least appreciated.\n\n\t\n\n\tMany a service is met with ingratitude..\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tReturn to the Aesop library , or . . .
