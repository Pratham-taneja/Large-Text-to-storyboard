A Porcupine was looking for a good home. At last he found a
little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes. He asked
them to let him share the cave with them, and the Snakes kindly
consented.\n\n\tThe Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay.
His sharp quills pricked them at every turn, and at last they
politely asked him to leave.\n\n\t"I am very well satisfied, thank you," said the Porcupine. "I
intend to stay right here." And with that, he politely escorted
the Snakes out of doors. And to save their skins, the Snakes had
to look for another home.\n\n\tGive a finger and lose a hand.\n\n\t9.0
