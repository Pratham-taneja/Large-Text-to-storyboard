A Stag had fallen sick. He had just strength enough to gather
some food and find a quiet clearing in the woods, where he lay
down to wait until his strength should return. The Animals heard
about the Stag's illness and came to ask after his health. Of
course, they were all hungry, and helped themselves freely to the
Stag's food; and as you would expect, the Stag soon starved to
death.\n\n\tGood will is worth nothing unless it is accompanied by good
acts.\n\n\t9.6
