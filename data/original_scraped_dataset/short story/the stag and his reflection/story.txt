A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in
the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his
antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.\n\n\t"How can it be," he sighed, "that I should be cursed with such
legs when I have so magnificent a crown."\n\n\tAt that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was
bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his
wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and
soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the
legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not
been for the useless ornaments on his head.\n\n\tWe often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.\n\n\t8.5
