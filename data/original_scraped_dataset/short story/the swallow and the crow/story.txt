The Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their
plumage.\n\n\tSaid the Swallow: "Just look at my bright and downy feathers.
Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why don't you dress
better? Show a little pride!"\n\n\t"Your feathers may do very well in spring," replied the Crow,
"butâ€”I don't remember ever having seen you around in winter, and
that's when I enjoy myself most."\n\n\tFriends in fine weather only, are not worth much.\n\n\t7.6
