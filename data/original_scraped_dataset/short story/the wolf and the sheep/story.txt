A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear. He was unable to
move and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst. A Sheep passed
by near his hiding place, and the Wolf called to him.\n\n\t"Please fetch me a drink of water," he begged, "that might give
me strength enough so I can get me some solid food."\n\n\t"Solid food!" said the Sheep. "That means me, I suppose. If I
should bring you a drink, it would only serve to wash me down
your throat. Don't talk to me about a drink!"\n\n\tA knave's hypocrisy is easily seen through.\n\n\t7.5
