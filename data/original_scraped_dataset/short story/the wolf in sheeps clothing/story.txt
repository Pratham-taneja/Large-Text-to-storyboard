A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the
watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep
skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day,
dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the
Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly
led away to slaughter.\n\n\tThat evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it
happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that
very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. There
the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.\n\n\tThe evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.\n\n\t8.3
