A pack of Wolves lurked near the Sheep pasture. But the Dogs kept
them all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed in
perfect safety. But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick the
Sheep.\n\n\t"Why is there always this hostility between us?" they said. "If
it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I
am sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and you
will see what good friends we shall become."\n\n\tThe Sheep were easily fooled. They persuaded the Dogs to go away,
and that very evening the Wolves had the grandest feast of their
lives.\n\n\tDo not give up friends for foes.\n\n\t9.1
