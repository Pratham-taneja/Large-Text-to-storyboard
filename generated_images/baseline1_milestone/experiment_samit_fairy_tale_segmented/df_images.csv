	The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt. She washed the blood off him, laid herbs on the wound, and said, 'Go to your bed, dear roe, that you may get well again.' But the wound was so slight that the roebuck, next morning, did not feel it any more. And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, 'I cannot bear it, I must be there; they shall not find it so easy to catch me.' The sister cried, and said, 'This time they will kill you, and here am I alone in the forest and forsaken by all the world. I will not let you out.' 'Then you will have me die of grief,' answered the roe; 'when I hear the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.' Then the sister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for him with a heavy heart, and the roebuck, full of health and joy, bounded into the forest.",little brother and little sister_segment_14.txt," The little sister was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt .

	Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. 'We will bake first,' said the old woman, 'I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.' She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. 'Creep in,' said the witch, 'and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.' And when once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in her mind, and said, 'I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?' 'Silly goose,' said the old woman, 'The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!' and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.",hansel and gretel_segment_14.txt," Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire .

	All at once the King's son entered, clothed in velvet and silk, with gold chains about his neck. And when he saw the beautiful woman standing by the door he seized her by the hand, and would have danced with her; but she refused and shrank with fear, for she saw that it was King Thrushbeard, her suitor whom she had driven away with scorn. Her struggles were of no avail, he drew her into the hall; but the string by which her pockets were hung broke, the pots fell down, the soup ran out, and the scraps were scattered all about. And when the people saw it, there arose general laughter and derision, and she was so ashamed that she would rather have been a thousand fathoms below the ground. She sprang to the door and would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught her and brought her back; and when she looked at him it was King Thrushbeard again. He said to her kindly, 'Do not be afraid, I and the fiddler who has been living with you in that wretched hovel are one. For love of you I disguised myself so; and I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery. This was all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish you for the insolence with which you mocked me.'",king thrushbeard_segment_18.txt," The King's son entered, clothed in velvet and silk, with gold chains about his neck .

	Thereupon the King and the Queen suffered great anguish, and the King said, 'Ah, how ill I have requited great fidelity!' and ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed. And as often as he looked on it he wept and said, 'Ah, if I could bring thee to life again, my most faithful John.' Some time passed and the Queen bore twins, two sons who grew fast and were her delight. Once when the Queen was at church and the two children were sitting playing beside their father, the latter full of grief again looked at the stone figure, sighed and said, 'Ah, if I could but bring thee to life again, my most faithful John.' Then the stone began to speak and said, 'Thou canst bring me to life again if thou wilt use for that purpose what is dearest to thee.' Then cried the King, 'I will give everything I have in the world for thee.' The stone continued, 'If thou wilt will cut off the heads of thy two children with thine own hand, and sprinkle me with their blood, I shall be restored to life.'",faithful john_segment_13.txt," The King and the Queen suffered great anguish, and ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed .

"There was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive, and when her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey them, so how could she fare well? One day she said to her parents, 'I have heard so much of Frau Trude, I will go to her some day. People say that everything about her does look so strange, and that there are such odd things in her house, that I have become quite curious!' Her parents absolutely forbade her, and said, 'Frau Trude is a bad woman, who does wicked things, and if thou goest to her; thou art no longer our child.' But the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parent's prohibition, and still went to Frau Trude. And when she got to her, Frau Trude said, 'Why art thou so pale?' 'Ah,' she replied, and her whole body trembled, 'I have been so terrified at what I have seen.' 'What hast thou seen?' 'I saw a black man on your steps.' 'That was a collier.' 'Then I saw a green man.' 'That was a huntsman.' 'After that I saw a blood-red man.' 'That was a butcher.' 'Ah, Frau Trude, I was terrified; I looked through the window and saw not you, but, as I verily believe, the devil himself with a head of fire.' 'Oho!' said she, 'then thou hast seen the witch in her proper costume. I have been waiting for thee, and wanting thee a long time already; thou shalt give me some light.' Then she changed the girl into a block of wood, and threw it into the fire. And when it was in full blaze she sat down close to it, and warmed herself by it, and said, 'That shines bright for once in a way.'",frau trude_segment_0.txt," A little girl was obstinate and inquisitive, and when her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey them .

	Then they journeyed onwards, and came to a kingdom where they heard that the King's daughter lay sick unto death. 'Hollo, brother!' said the soldier to St. Peter, 'this is a chance for us; if we can heal her we shall be provided for, for life!' But St. Peter was not half quick enough for him, 'Come, lift your legs, my dear brother,' said he, 'that we may get there in time.' But St. Peter walked slower and slower, though Brother Lustig did all he could to drive and push him on, and at last they heard that the princess was dead. 'Now we are done for!' said Brother Lustig; 'that comes of thy sleepy way of walking!' 'Just be quiet,' answered St. Peter, 'I can do more than cure sick people; I can bring dead ones to life again.' 'Well, if thou canst do that,' said Brother Lustig, 'it's all right, but thou shouldst earn at least half the kingdom for us by that.' Then they went to the royal palace, where every one was in great grief, but St. Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life. He was taken to her, and said, 'Bring me a kettle and some water,' and when that was brought, he bade everyone go out, and allowed no one to remain with him but Brother Lustig. Then he cut off all the dead girl's limbs, and threw them in the water, lighted a fire beneath the kettle, and boiled them. And when the flesh had fallen away from the bones, he took out the beautiful white bones, and laid them on a table, and arranged them together in their natural order. When he had done that, he stepped forward and said three times, 'In the name of the holy Trinity, dead woman, arise.' And at the third time, the princess arose, living, healthy and beautiful. Then the King was in the greatest joy, and said to St. Peter, 'Ask for thy reward; even if it were half my kingdom, I would give it thee.' But St. Peter said, 'I want nothing for it.' 'Oh, thou tomfool!' thought Brother Lustig to himself, and nudged his comrade's side, and said, 'Don't be so stupid! If thou hast no need of anything, I have.' St. Peter, however, would have nothing, but as the King saw that the other would very much like to have something, he ordered his treasurer to fill Brother Lustig's knapsack with gold. Then they went on their way, and when they came to a forest, St. Peter said to Brother Lustig, 'Now, we will divide the gold.' 'Yes,' he replied, 'we will.' So St. Peter divided the gold, and divided it into three heaps. Brother Lustig thought to himself, 'What craze has he got in his head now? He is making three shares, and there are only two of us!' But St. Peter said, 'I have divided it exactly; there is one share for me, one for thee, and one for him who ate the lamb's heart.'",brother lustig_segment_3.txt," St. Peter told the King that he would restore his daughter to life .

And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat.

	And none is so fair as she.'

	When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that little Snow-white was again alive. 'But now,' she said, 'I will think of something that shall put an end to you,' and by the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb. Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman. So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door, and cried, 'Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!' Little Snow-white looked out and said, 'Go away; I cannot let any one come in.' 'I suppose you can look,' said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door. When they had made a bargain the old woman said, 'Now I will comb you properly for once.' Poor little Snow-white had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl fell down senseless.

Then he said to the dwarfs, 'Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.' But the dwarfs answered, 'We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.'

'Good things, pretty things,' she answered; 'stay-laces of all colours,' and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk.

'But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,' said the cat, 'and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.' The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said, 'I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.' So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse, 'I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.

Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.

And when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger, and asked who he was. So he answered, 'I am a merchant,' and opened his apron, and let her look in. Then she cried, 'Oh, what beautiful gold things!' and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other. Then said the girl, 'The princess must see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have.' She took him by the hand and led him upstairs, for she was the waiting-maid.

Then Brother Lustig also received his dismissal, and besides that, nothing but a small loaf of contract-bread, and four kreuzers in money, with which he departed. St. Peter had, however, placed himself in his way in the shape of a poor beggar, and when Brother Lustig came up, he begged alms of him. Brother Lustig replied, 'Dear beggar-man, what am I to give you? I have been a soldier, and have received my dismissal, and have nothing but this little loaf of contract-bread, and four kreuzers of money; when that is gone, I shall have to beg as well as you. Still I will give you something.' Thereupon he divided the loaf into four parts, and gave the apostle one of them, and a kreuzer likewise. St. Peter thanked him, went onwards, and threw himself again in the soldier's way as a beggar, but in another shape; and when he came up begged a gift of him as before. Brother Lustig spoke as he had done before, and again gave him a quarter of the loaf and one kreuzer. St. Peter thanked him, and went onwards, but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a beggar on the road, and spoke to Brother Lustig. Brother Lustig gave him also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer. St. Peter thanked him, and Brother Lustig went onwards, and had but a quarter of the loaf, and one kreuzer. With that he went into an inn, ate the bread, and ordered one kreuzer's worth of beer. When he had had it, he journeyed onwards, and then St. Peter, who had assumed the appearance of a discharged soldier, met and spoke to him thus: 'Good day, comrade, canst thou not give me a bit of bread, and a kreuzer to get a drink?' 'Where am I to procure it?' answered Brother Lustig; 'I have been discharged, and I got nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzers in money.

Now my pockets are empty, and if thou also hast nothing we can go a-begging together.' 'No,' answered St. Peter, 'we need not quite do that. I know a little about medicine, and I will soon earn as much as I require by that.' 'Indeed,' said Brother Lustig, 'I know nothing of that, so I must go and beg alone.'

At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, 'Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.' As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, 'Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.' He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up. When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, 'Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee get into the water,' and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake. Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, 'As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.' Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going. 'Oh, to the next place.' Then what his name was? 'Ferdinand the Faithful.'

Scarcely, however, had they sat down at the top of it than the rascals came thither who carry away with them what does not want to go, and find things before they are lost. They sat down under the very tree in which Frederick and Catherine were sitting, lighted a fire, and were about to share their booty. Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together. Then he climbed up again with them, and wished to throw them at the thieves and kill them. The stones, however, did not hit them, and the knaves cried, 'It will soon be morning, the wind is shaking down the fir-apples.' Catherine still had the door on her back, and as it pressed so heavily on her, she thought it was the fault of the dried pears, and said, 'Frederick, I must throw the pears down.'

Then the woman said to the servant, 'Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.' The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly.

The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the mother likewise, 'What a clever Elsie we have!' and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said, 'I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.'

	The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, 'Now all is over with us.' 'Be quiet, Gretel,' said Hansel, 'do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.' And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, 'Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,' and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying 'Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.' She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, 'There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.' Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, 'Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for? Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.' 'Ah, father,' said Hansel, 'I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.'

Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night. Then Gambling Hansel said, 'For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat.' So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which Gambling Hansel made no objection. Thereupon St. Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker's and fetch some bread. So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, 'Hansel, do come in.' 'Oh,' said he, 'do you want to win the three groschen too?' On this they would not let him go. So he went in, and played away the three groschen also. Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him. When Gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play. St. Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf.

After this all was suddenly quiet, and Brother Lustig lay down again, and slept till it was bright day. Then came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle belonged, to see how he had fared; but when they perceived that he was merry and well they were astonished, and asked, 'Have the spirits done you no harm, then?' 'The reason why they have not,' answered Brother Lustig, 'is because I have got the whole nine of them in my knapsack! You may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them will ever haunt it again.' The nobleman thanked him, made him rich presents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would provide for him as long as he lived. 'No,' replied Brother Lustig, 'I am used to wandering about, I will travel farther.' Then he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack, which contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and his apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers with all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were quite pitiable. When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of them were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was still alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell. Thereupon Brother Lustig travelled a long time about the world, and those who know them can tell many a story about him, but at last he grew old, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to be a pious man, and said to him, 'I am tired of wandering about, and want now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.' The hermit replied, 'There are two roads, one is broad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough, and leads to heaven.' 'I should be a fool,' thought Brother Lustig, 'if I were to take the narrow, rough road.' So he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length came to a great black door, which was the door of Hell. Brother Lustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there. But when he saw Brother Lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very same ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had escaped from it with a black eye. So he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the devil's lieutenant, and said, 'There is a fellow outside with a knapsack, who wants to come in, but as you value your lives don't allow him to enter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack. He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.' So they called out to Brother Lustig that he was to go away again, for he should not get in there! 'If they won't have me here,' thought he, 'I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must be somewhere.' So he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of Heaven, where he knocked. St. Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper. Brother Lustig recognised him at once, and thought, 'Here I find an old friend, I shall get on better.' But St. Peter said, 'I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven.' 'Let me in, brother; I must get in somewhere; if they would have taken me into Hell, I should not have come here.' 'No,' said St. Peter, 'thou shalt not enter.' 'Then if thou wilt not let me in, take thy knapsack back, for I will have nothing at all from thee.' 'Give it here, then,' said St. Peter. Then Brother Lustig gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside his seat. Then said Brother Lustig, 'And now I wish myself inside my knapsack,' and in a second he was in it, and in Heaven, and St. Peter was forced to let him stay there.",brother lustig_segment_8.txt," Brother Lustig travelled a long time about the world, but at last he grew old, and thought of his end .

	Brother Lustig travelled about with his money, and squandered and wasted what he had as before. When at last he had no more than four kreuzers, he passed by an inn and thought, 'The money must go,' and ordered three kreuzers' worth of wine and one kreuzer's worth of bread for himself. As he was sitting there drinking, the smell of roast goose made its way to his nose. Brother Lustig looked about and peeped, and saw that the host had two geese standing in the oven. Then he remembered that his comrade had said that whatsoever he wished to have in his knapsack should be there, so he said, 'Oh, ho! I must try that with the geese.' So he went out, and when he was outside the door, he said, 'I wish those two roasted geese out of the oven and in my knapsack,' and when he had said that, he unbuckled it and looked in, and there they were inside it. 'Ah, that's right!' said he, 'now I am a made man!' and went away to a meadow and took out the roast meat. When he was in the midst of his meal, two journeymen came up and looked at the second goose, which was not yet touched, with hungry eyes. Brother Lustig thought to himself, 'One is enough for me,' and called the two men up and said, 'Take the goose, and eat it to my health.' They thanked him, and went with it to the inn, ordered themselves a half bottle of wine and a loaf, took out the goose which had been given them, and began to eat. The hostess saw them and said to her husband, 'Those two are eating a goose; just look and see if it is not one of ours, out of the oven.' The landlord ran thither, and behold the oven was empty! 'What!' cried he, 'you thievish crew, you want to eat goose as cheap as that? Pay for it this moment; or I will wash you well with green hazel-sap.' The two said, 'We are no thieves, a discharged soldier gave us the goose, outside there in the meadow.' 'You shall not throw dust in my eyes that way! the soldier was here but he went out by the door, like an honest fellow. I looked after him myself; you are the thieves and shall pay!' But as they could not pay, he took a stick, and cudgeled them out of the house.",brother lustig_segment_6.txt," Brother Lustig travelled about with his money, and squandered and wasted what he had as before .

'It surprises me that they should come to you and not go to that splendid castle,' said Brother Lustig.

	When therefore they came to shore, all happened as had been foretold by the ravens, and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang forward. 'Good,' said the King, 'he shall carry me to my palace,' and was about to mount it when Faithful John got before him, jumped quickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the horse. Then the other attendants of the King, who after all were not very fond of Faithful John, cried, 'How shameful to kill the beautiful animal, that was to have carried the King to his palace.' But the King said, 'Hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John, who knows what may be the good of that!' They went into the palace, and in the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment looking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver.

Faithful John, however, remained behind with the pilot, and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying, 'Set all sail, till it fly like a bird in air.'

"There was once a man who understood all kinds of arts; he served in war, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he received his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the way. 'Stop,' said he, 'I shall not be content with this. If I can only meet with the right people, the King will yet have to give me all the treasure of the country.' Then full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing therein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn. He said to him, 'Wilt thou be my servant and go with me?' 'Yes,' he answered, 'but, first, I will take this little bundle of sticks home to my mother,' and he took one of the trees, and wrapped it round the five others, lifted the bundle on his back, and carried it away. Then he returned and went with his master, who said, 'We two ought to be able to get through the world very well,' and when they had walked on for a short while they found a huntsman who was kneeling, had shouldered his gun, and was about to fire. The master said to him, 'Huntsman, what art thou going to shoot?' He answered, 'Two miles from here a fly is sitting on the branch of an oak-tree, and I want to shoot its left eye out.' 'Oh, come with me,' said the man, 'if we three are together, we certainly ought to be able to get on in the world!' The huntsman was ready, and went with him, and they came to seven windmills whose sails were turning round with great speed, and yet no wind was blowing either on the right or the left, and no leaf was stirring. Then said the man, 'I know not what is driving the windmills, not a breath of air is stirring,' and he went onwards with his servants, and when they had walked two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree who was shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the other. 'Good gracious! what are you doing up there?' He answered, 'Two miles from here are seven windmills; look, I am blowing them till they turn round.' 'Oh, come with me,' said the man. 'If we four are together, we shall carry the whole world before us!'

	But it pained the King, and still more his daughter, that she should be carried off by a common disbanded soldier like that; so they took counsel with each other how to get rid of him and his companions. Then said the King to her, 'I have thought of a way; don't be afraid, they shall not come back again.' And he said to them, 'You shall now make merry together, and eat and drink,' and he conducted them to a room which had a floor of iron, and the doors also were of iron, and the windows were guarded with iron bars. There was a table in the room covered with delicious food, and the King said to them, 'Go in, and enjoy yourselves.' And when they were inside, he ordered the doors to be shut and bolted. Then he sent for the cook, and commanded him to make a fire under the room until the iron became red-hot. This the cook did, and the six who were sitting at table began to feel quite warm, and they thought the heat was caused by the food; but as it became still greater, and they wanted to get out, and found that the doors and windows were bolted, they became aware that the King must have an evil intention, and wanted to suffocate them. 'He shall not succeed, however,' said the one with the cap. 'I will cause a frost to come, before which the fire shall be ashamed, and creep away.' Then he put his cap on straight, and immediately there came such a frost that all heat disappeared, and the food on the dishes began to freeze. When an hour or two had passed by, and the King believed that they had perished in the heat, he had the doors opened to behold them himself. But when the doors were opened, all six were standing there, alive and well, and said that they should very much like to get out to warm themselves, for the very food was fast frozen to the dishes with the cold. Then, full of anger, the King went down to the cook, scolded him, and asked why he had not done what he had been ordered to do. But the cook replied, 'There is heat enough there, just look yourself.'

"There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife. He therefore seated Hans behind the stove, and had it made very hot. Then he fetched a pot of milk and plenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his hand, and said, 'Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white bread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from that spot till I come back.' 'Yes,' said Hans, 'I will do all that.'

	On this the King was satisfied, and the other continued, 'In fourteen days, I will come and fetch it.' Thereupon he summoned together all the tailors in the whole kingdom, and they were to sit for fourteen days and sew a sack. And when it was ready, the strong one who could tear up trees had to take it on his back, and go with it to the King. Then said the King, 'Who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a bundle of linen on his back that is as big as a house?' and he was alarmed and said, 'What a lot of gold he can carry away!' Then he commanded a ton of gold to be brought; it took sixteen of his strongest men to carry it, but the strong one snatched it up in one hand, put it in his sack, and said, 'Why don't you bring more at the same time? that hardly covers the bottom!' Then, little by little, the King caused all his treasure to be brought thither, and the strong one pushed it into the sack, and still the sack was not half full with it. 'Bring more,' cried he, 'these few crumbs don't fill it.' Then seven thousand carts with gold had to be gathered together in the whole kingdom, and the strong one thrust them and the oxen harnessed to them into his sack. 'I will examine it no longer,' said he, 'but will just take what comes, so long as the sack is but full.' When all that was inside, there was still room for a great deal more; Then he said, 'I will just make an end of the thing; people do sometimes tie up a sack even when it is not full.' So he took it on his back, and went away with his comrades. When the King now saw how one single man was carrying away the entire wealth of the country, he became enraged, and bade his horsemen mount and pursue the six, and ordered them to take the sack away from the strong one. Two regiments speedily overtook the six, and called out, 'You are prisoners, put down the sack with the gold, or you will all be cut to pieces!' 'What say you?' cried the blower, 'that we are prisoners! Rather than that should happen, all of you shall dance about in the air.' And he closed one nostril, and with the other blew on the two regiments. Then they were driven away from each other, and carried into the blue sky over all the mountains one here, the other there. One sergeant cried for mercy; he had nine wounds, and was a brave fellow who did not deserve ill treatment. The blower stopped a little so that he came down without injury, and then the blower said to him, 'Now go home to thy King, and tell him he had better send some more horsemen, and I will blow them all into the air.'

	Now the six came to a town where the King had proclaimed that whosoever ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be her husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head. Then the man presented himself and said, 'I will, however, let my servant run for me.' The King replied, 'Then his life also must be staked, so that his head and thine are both set on the victory.' When that was settled and made secure, the man buckled the other leg on the runner, and said to him, 'Now be nimble, and help us to win.' It was fixed that the one who was first to bring some water from a far distant well was to be the victor. The runner received a pitcher, and the King's daughter one too, and they began to run at the same time, but in an instant, when the King's daughter had got a very little way, the people who were looking on could see no more of the runner, and it was just as if the wind had whistled by. In a short time he reached the well, filled his pitcher with water, and turned back. Half-way home, however, he was overcome with fatigue, and set his pitcher down, lay down himself, and fell asleep. He had, however, made a pillow of a horse's skull which was lying on the ground, in order that he might lie uncomfortably, and soon wake up again. In the meantime the King's daughter, who could also run very well quite as well as any ordinary mortal can had reached the well, and was hurrying back with her pitcher full of water, and when she saw the runner lying there asleep, she was glad and said, 'My enemy is delivered over into my hands,' emptied his pitcher, and ran on. And now all would have been lost if by good luck the huntsman had not been standing at the top of the castle, and had not seen everything with his sharp eyes. Then said he, 'The King's daughter shall still not prevail against us;' and he loaded his gun, and shot so cleverly, that he shot the horse's skull away from under the runner's head without hurting him. Then the runner awoke, leapt up, and saw that his pitcher was empty, and that the King's daughter was already far in advance. He did not lose heart, however, but ran back to the well with his pitcher, again drew some water, and was at home again, ten minutes before the King's daughter.

	Catherine stood for a while and bethought to herself; then she said, 'Listen, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back again, we will run after the thieves.' 'Come, then,' said Frederick, 'we will try it; but take with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat on the way.' 'Yes, Frederick, I will take them.' They set out, and as Frederick was the better walker, Catherine followed him. 'It is to my advantage,' thought she, 'when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance.' Then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides of the road. 'There one can see,' said Catherine, 'how they have torn and skinned and galled the poor earth, it will never be whole again as long as it lives,' and in her heart's compassion she took her butter and smeared the ruts right and left, that they might not be so hurt by the wheels, and as she was thus bending down in her charity, one of the cheeses rolled out of her pocket down the hill. Said Catherine, 'I have made my way once up here, I will not go down again; another may run and fetch it back.' So she took another cheese and rolled it down. But the cheeses did not come back, so she let a third run down, thinking. 'Perhaps they are waiting for company, and do not like to walk alone.' As all three stayed away she said, 'I do not know what that can mean, but it may perhaps be that the third has not found the way, and has gone wrong, I will just send the fourth to call it.' But the fourth did no better than the third. Then Catherine was angry, and threw down the fifth and sixth as well, and these were her last. She remained standing for some time watching for their coming, but when they still did not come, she said, 'Oh, you are good folks to send in search of death, you stay a fine long time away! Do you think I will wait any longer for you? I shall go my way, you may run after me; you have younger legs than I.' Catherine went on and found Frederick, who was standing waiting for her because he wanted something to eat. 'Now just let us have what you have brought with you,' said he. She gave him the dry bread. 'Where have you the butter and the cheeses?' asked the man. 'Ah, Freddy,' said Catherine, 'I smeared the cart-ruts with the butter and the cheeses will come soon; one ran away from me, so I sent the others after to call it.' Said Frederick, 'You should not have done that, Catherine, to smear the butter on the road, and let the cheeses run down the hill!' 'Really, Frederick, you should have told me.'

'Then go home again, and make the house safe before we go any farther, and bring with you something else to eat. I will wait here for you.' Catherine went back and thought, 'Frederick wants something more to eat, he does not like butter and cheese, so I will take with me a handkerchief full of dried pears and a pitcher of vinegar for him to drink.' Then she bolted the upper half of the door fast, but unhinged the lower door, and took it on her back, believing that when she had placed the door in security the house must be well taken care of. Catherine took her time on the way, and thought, 'Frederick will rest himself so much the longer.' When she had once reached him she said, 'Here is the house-door for you, Frederick, and now you can take care of the house yourself.' 'Oh, heavens,' said he, 'what a wise wife I have! She takes the under-door off the hinges that everything may run in, and bolts the upper one. It is now too late to go back home again, but since you have brought the door here, you shall just carry it farther.' 'I will carry the door, Frederick, but the dried pears and the vinegar-jug will be too heavy for me, I will hang them on the door, it may carry them.'",frederick and catherine_segment_1.txt," Catherine smeared the ruts on the road with her butter and smeared cheese down the hillside .

	Then St. Peter went a different road, but Brother Lustig thought, 'It is a good thing that he has taken himself off, he is certainly a strange saint, after all.' Then he had money enough, but did not know how to manage it, squandered it, gave it away, and and when some time had gone by, once more had nothing. Then he arrived in a certain country where he heard that a King's daughter was dead. 'Oh, ho!' thought he, 'that may be a good thing for me; I will bring her to life again, and see that I am paid as I ought to be.' So he went to the King, and offered to raise the dead girl to life again. Now the King had heard that a discharged soldier was traveling about and bringing dead persons to life again, and thought that Brother Lustig was the man; but as he had no confidence in him, he consulted his councillors first, who said that he might give it a trial as his daughter was dead. Then Brother Lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle, bade every one go out, cut the limbs off, threw them in the water and lighted a fire beneath, just as he had seen St. Peter do. The water began to boil, the flesh fell off, and then he took the bones out and laid them on the table, but he did not know the order in which to lay them, and placed them all wrong and in confusion. Then he stood before them and said, 'In the name of the most holy Trinity, dead maiden, I bid thee arise,' and he said this thrice, but the bones did not stir. So he said it thrice more, but also in vain: 'Confounded girl that you are, get up!' cried he, 'Get up, or it shall be worse for you!' When he had said that, St. Peter suddenly appeared in his former shape as a discharged soldier; he entered by the window and said, 'Godless man, what art thou doing? How can the dead maiden arise, when thou hast thrown about her bones in such confusion?' 'Dear brother, I have done everything to the best of my ability,' he answered. 'This once, I will help thee out of thy difficulty, but one thing I tell thee, and that is that if ever thou undertakest anything of the kind again, it will be the worse for thee, and also that thou must neither demand nor accept the smallest thing from the King for this!' Thereupon St. Peter laid the bones in their right order, said to the maiden three times, 'In the name of the most holy Trinity, dead maiden, arise,' and the King's daughter arose, healthy and beautiful as before. Then St. Peter went away again by the window, and Brother Lustig was rejoiced to find that all had passed off so well, but was very much vexed to think that after all he was not to take anything for it. 'I should just like to know,' thought he, 'what fancy that fellow has got in his head, for what he gives with one hand he takes away with the other there is no sense whatever in it!' Then the King offered Brother Lustig whatsoever he wished to have, but he did not dare to take anything; however, by hints and cunning, he contrived to make the King order his knapsack to be filled with gold for him, and with that he departed. When he got out, St. Peter was standing by the door, and said, 'Just look what a man thou art; did I not forbid thee to take anything, and there thou hast thy knapsack full of gold!' 'How can I help that,' answered Brother Lustig, 'if people will put it in for me?' 'Well, I tell thee this, that if ever thou settest about anything of this kind again thou shalt suffer for it!' 'Eh, brother, have no fear, now I have money, why should I trouble myself with washing bones?' 'Faith,' said St. Peter, 'the gold will last a long time! In order that after this thou mayst never tread in forbidden paths, I will bestow on thy knapsack this property, namely, that whatsoever thou wishest to have inside it, shall be there. Farewell, thou wilt now never see me more.' 'Good-bye,' said Brother Lustig, and thought to himself, 'I am very glad that thou hast taken thyself off, thou strange fellow; I shall certainly not follow thee.' But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his knapsack, he thought no more.",brother lustig_segment_5.txt," St. Peter appeared in his former shape as a discharged soldier and appeared by the window .

"There was once on a time a man who was called Frederick and a woman called Catherine, who had married each other and lived together as young married folks. One day Frederick said, 'I will now go and plough, Catherine; when I come back, there must be some roast meat on the table for hunger, and a fresh draught for thirst.' 'Just go, Frederick,' answered Kate, 'just go, I will have all ready for you.' Therefore when dinner-time drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney, put it in the frying-pan, put some butter to it, and set it on the fire. The sausage began to fry and to hiss, Catherine stood beside it and held the handle of the pan, and had her own thoughts as she was doing it. Then it occurred to her, 'While the sausage is getting done thou couldst go into the cellar and draw beer.' So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire, took a can, and went down into the cellar to draw beer. The beer ran into the can and Kate watched it, and then she thought, 'Oh, dear! The dog upstairs is not fastened up, it might get the sausage out of the pan. Well thought of.' And in a trice she was up the cellar-steps again, but the Spitz had the sausage in its mouth already, and trailed it away on the ground. But Catherine, who was not idle, set out after it, and chased it a long way into the field; the dog, however, was swifter than Catherine and did not let the sausage journey easily, but skipped over the furrows with it. 'What's gone is gone!' said Kate, and turned round, and as she had run till she was weary, she walked quietly and comfortably, and cooled herself. During this time the beer was still running out of the cask, for Kate had not turned the tap. And when the can was full and there was no other place for it, it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask was empty. As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance. 'Good gracious!' she cried. 'What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it!' She thought for a while, and at last she remembered that up in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest wheat flour from the last fair, and she would fetch that down and strew it over the beer. 'Yes,' said she, 'he who saves a thing when he ought, has it afterwards when he needs it,' and she climbed up to the garret and carried the sack below, and threw it straight down on the can of beer, which she knocked over, and Frederick's draught swam also in the cellar. 'It is all right,' said Kate, 'where the one is the other ought to be also,' and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar. When it was done she was heartily delighted with her work, and said, 'How clean and wholesome it does look here!' At mid-day home came Frederick: 'Now, wife, what have you ready for me?' 'Ah, Freddy,' she answered, 'I was frying a sausage for you, but whilst I was drawing the beer to drink with it, the dog took it away out of the pan, and whilst I was running after the dog, all the beer ran out, and whilst I was drying up the beer with the flour, I knocked over the can as well, but be easy, the cellar is quite dry again.' Said Frederick, 'Kate, Kate, you should not have done that! to let the sausage be carried off and the beer run out of the cask, and throw out all our flour into the bargain!' 'Indeed, Frederick, I did not know that, you should have told me.' The man thought, 'If my wife is like this, I must look after things more.' Now he had got together a good number of thalers which he changed into gold, and said to Catherine, 'Look, these are counters for playing games; I will put them in a pot and bury them in the stable under the cow's manger, but mind you keep away from them, or it will be the worse for you.' Said she, 'Oh, no, Frederick, I certainly will not go.' And when Frederick was gone some pedlars came into the village who had cheap earthen-bowls and pots, and asked the young woman if there was nothing she wanted to bargain with them for? 'Oh, dear people,' said Catherine, 'I have no money and can buy nothing, but if you have any use for yellow counters I will buy of you.' 'Yellow counters, why not? But just let us see them.' 'Then go into the stable and dig under the cow's manger, and you will find the yellow counters. I am not allowed to go there.' The rogues went thither, dug and found pure gold. Then they laid hold of it, ran away, and left their pots and bowls behind in the house. Catherine though she must use her new things, and as she had no lack in the kitchen already without these, she knocked the bottom out of every pot, and set them all as ornaments on the paling which went round about the house. When Frederick came and saw the new decorations, he said, 'Catherine, what have you been about?' 'I have bought them, Frederick, for the counters which were under the cow's manger. I did not go there myself, the pedlars had to dig them out for themselves.' 'Ah, wife,' said Frederick, 'what have you done? Those were not counters, but pure gold, and all our wealth; you should not have done that.' 'Indeed, Frederick,' said she, 'I did not know that, you should have forewarned me.'",frederick and catherine_segment_0.txt," A man who was called Frederick and a woman called Catherine married each other and lived together as young married folks .

	Then they came to a peasant's house inside which they heard loud lamentations and cries; so they went in, and there the husband was lying sick unto death, and very near his end, and his wife was crying and weeping quite loudly. 'Stop that howling and crying,' said St. Peter, 'I will make the man well again,' and he took a salve out of his pocket, and healed the sick man in a moment, so that he could get up, and was in perfect health. In great delight the man and his wife said, 'How can we reward you? What shall we give you?' But St. Peter would take nothing, and the more the peasant folks offered him, the more he refused. Brother Lustig, however, nudged St. Peter, and said, 'Take something; sure enough we are in need of it.' At length the woman brought a lamb and said to St. Peter that he really must take that, but he would not. Then Brother Lustig gave him a poke in the side, and said, 'Do take it, you stupid fool; we are in great want of it!' Then St. Peter said at last, 'Well, I will take the lamb, but I won't carry it; if thou wilt insist on having it, thou must carry it.' 'That is nothing,' said Brother Lustig. 'I will easily carry it,' and took it on his shoulder. Then they departed and came to a wood, but Brother Lustig had begun to feel the lamb heavy, and he was hungry, so he said to St. Peter, 'Look, that's a good place, we might cook the lamb there, and eat it.' 'As you like,' answered St. Peter, 'but I can't have anything to do with the cooking; if thou wilt cook, there is a kettle for thee, and in the meantime I will walk about a little until it is ready. Thou must, however, not begin to eat until I have come back, I will come at the right time.' 'Well, go, then,' said Brother Lustig, 'I understand cookery, I will manage it.' Then St. Peter went away, and Brother Lustig killed the lamb, lighted a fire, threw the meat into the kettle, and boiled it. The lamb was, however, quite ready, and the apostle Peter had not come back, so Brother Lustig took it out of the kettle, cut it up, and found the heart. 'That is said to be the best part,' said he, and tasted it, but at last he ate it all up. At length St. Peter returned and said, 'Thou mayst eat the whole of the lamb thyself, I will only have the heart, give me that.' Then Brother Lustig took a knife and fork, and pretended to look anxiously about amongst the lamb's flesh, but not to be able to find the heart, and at last he said abruptly, 'There is none here.' 'But where can it be?' said the apostle. 'I don't know,' replied Brother Lustig, 'but look, what fools we both are, to seek for the lamb's heart, and neither of us to remember that a lamb has no heart!' 'Oh,' said St. Peter, 'that is something quite new! Every animal has a heart, why is a lamb to have none?' 'No, be assured, my brother,' said Brother Lustig, 'that a lamb has no heart; just consider it seriously, and then you will see that it really has none.' 'Well, it is all right,' said St. Peter, 'if there is no heart, then I want none of the lamb; thou mayst eat it alone.' 'What I can't eat now, I will carry away in my knapsack,' said Brother Lustig, and he ate half the lamb, and put the rest in his knapsack.",brother lustig_segment_1.txt," St. Peter refused to take anything, but Brother Lustig nudged him and said, 'Take something; sure enough we are in need of it' The apostle refused, and the more the peasant folks offered him, the more he"

	Then said the third, 'I know still more; even if the bridal garment be burnt, the young King will still not have his bride.

	So the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the young wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom's property, Hans took off his Sunday coat and put on his patched smock-frock and said, 'I might spoil my good coat.' Then together they went out and wherever a boundary line came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each other, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large or a small patch on his smock-frock, and said, 'That patch is mine, and that too, my dearest, just look at it,' meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which was his own.",hans married_segment_1.txt," Hans took off his Sunday coat and put on his patched smock-frock and said, 'I might spoil my good coat' Then together they went out and wherever a boundary line came in sight, Hans pointed with his finger and"

	After Hans had had her some time, he said, 'Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.' 'Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.' After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to herself, 'What shall I do; shall I shear first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.' Then she emptied her basin of broth, and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said, 'What shall I do? Shall I shear first, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.' Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he, 'What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.' As, however, she still stayed away, and it was evening, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler's net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said, 'Is it I, or is it not I?' But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought, 'I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.' She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried, 'Hans, is Elsie within?' 'Yes,' answered Hans, 'she is within.' Hereupon she was terrified, and said, 'Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,' and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since.",clever elsie_segment_2.txt," Clever Elsie cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her .

	Then they went down together, and the King awoke, and the Queen, and the whole court, and looked at each other in great astonishment. And the horses in the court-yard stood up and shook themselves; the hounds jumped up and wagged their tails; the pigeons upon the roof pulled out their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the open country; the flies on the wall crept again; the fire in the kitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat; the joint began to turn and frizzle again, and the cook gave the boy such a box on the ear that he screamed, and the maid plucked the fowl ready for the spit.",briar rose_segment_15.txt," The fire in the kitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat .

"Lean Lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy Harry and fat Trina, who never let anything disturb their peace. She scoured everything with ashes, from morning till evening, and burdened her husband, Long Laurence, with so much work that he had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks. It was, however, all to no purpose, they had nothing and came to nothing. One night as she lay in bed, and could hardly move one limb for weariness, she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep. She thrust her elbows into her husband's side, and said, 'Listen, Lenz, to what I have been thinking: if I were to find one florin and one was given to me, I would borrow another to put to them, and thou too shouldst give me another, and then as soon as I had got the four florins together, I would buy a young cow.' This pleased the husband right well. 'It is true,' said he, 'that I do not know where I am to get the florin which thou wantest as a gift from me; but, if thou canst get the money together, and canst buy a cow with it, thou wilt do well to carry out thy project. I shall be glad,' he added, 'if the cow has a calf, and then I shall often get a drink of milk to refresh me.' 'The milk is not for thee,' said the woman, 'we must let the calf suck that it may become big and fat, and we may be able to sell it well.' 'Certainly,' replied the man, 'but still we will take a little milk; that will do no harm.' 'Who has taught thee to manage cows?' said the woman; 'Whether it does harm or not, I will not allow it, and even if thou wert to stand on thy head for it, thou shouldst not have a drop of the milk! Dost thou think, because there is no satisfying thee, Long Laurence, that thou art to eat up what I earn with so much difficulty?' 'Wife,' said the man, 'be quiet, or I will give thee a blow on thy mouth!' 'What!' cried she, 'thou threatenest me, thou glutton, thou rascal, thou lazy Harry!' She was just laying hold of his hair, but long Laurence got up, seized both Lean Lisa's withered arms in one hand, and with the other he pressed down her head into the pillow, let her scold, and held her until she fell asleep for very weariness.

	So St. Peter said to the Lord, 'Lord, this thing must not go on. People no longer die; we must go ourselves.' And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down. So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, 'Come down,' and Death took him directly and put an end to him. They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it. 'Who is there?' 'Gambling Hansel.' 'Ah, we will have nothing to do with him! Begone!' So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more. 'Who is there?' 'Gambling Hansel.' 'Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him. We do not want to gamble, just go away again.' Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in. There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world. And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again. Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, 'Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.' And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, 'Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.' So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day.",gambling hansel_segment_2.txt," St. Peter said to the Lord, 'Lord, this thing must not go on.

	After this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin, and at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage, and drove with them. When, however, they reached the house of Herr Korbes, Herr Korbes was not there. The mice drew the carriage into the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch. The cat sat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole. The egg rolled itself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion, the needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and the millstone laid itself over the door. Then Herr Korbes came home, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when the cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face. He ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some water in his face. He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the egg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes. He wanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin pricked him. He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed, but as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked him, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out into the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the house-door, the millstone leapt down and struck him dead.

	Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. She said to the mouse, 'You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.' The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. 'Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,' said she, and was quite satisfied with her day's work. When she went home the mouse inquired, 'And what was this child christened?' 'Half-done,' answered the cat. 'Half-done! What are you saying?

	Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal. Then she went to them and said, 'I will help you to steal.' The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place, and were willing. Catherine went in front of the houses, and cried, 'Good folks, have you anything? We want to steal.' The thieves thought to themselves, 'That's a fine way of doing things,' and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine. Then they said to her, 'Outside the village the pastor has some turnips in the field. Go there and pull up some turnips for us.' Catherine went to the ground, and began to pull them up, but was so idle that she did not gather them together. Then a man came by, saw her, and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus rooting amongst the turnips. He ran away into the village to the pastor, and said, 'Mr. Pastor, the devil is in your turnip-ground, rooting up turnips.' 'Ah, heavens,' answered the pastor, 'I have a lame foot, I cannot go out and drive him away.' Said the man, 'Then I will carry you on my back,' and he carried him out on his back. And when they came to the ground, Catherine arose and stood up her full height.

	When the old King had been carried to his grave, Faithful John told the young King all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, 'This will I assuredly perform, and will be faithful to thee as I have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.' When the mourning was over, Faithful John said to him, 'It is now time that thou shouldst see thine inheritance. I will show thee thy father's palace.' Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was one room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous picture. The picture was, however, so placed that when the door was opened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful in the whole world. The young King, however, plainly remarked that Faithful John always walked past this one door, and said, 'Why dost thou never open this one for me?' 'There is something within it,' he replied, 'which would terrify thee.' But the King answered, 'I have seen all the palace, and I will know what is in this room also,' and he went and tried to break open the door by force. Then Faithful John held him back and said, 'I promised thy father before his death that thou shouldst not see that which is in this chamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on thee and on me.' 'Ah, no,' replied the young King, 'if I do not go in, it will be my certain destruction. I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes.

'Yes,' answered the King, 'it shall be granted unto thee.' Then said Faithful John, 'I am unjustly condemned, and have always been true to thee,' and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the ravens when on the sea, and how he had been obliged to do all these things in order to save his master.

Then by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the Faithful was called, and the King told him he must fetch the writings from the castle, or he should die. Then he went once more into the stable, and bemoaned himself and said, 'Oh, my dear little white horse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?' Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again. So it happened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the birds were satisfied, and made gentle by the meat.
